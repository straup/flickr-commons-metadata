He was the first one out of the Hall. As the fiends came rushing\nin, Andrew ran as fast as he could for a block when overcome by a man\nin blue who threw a pot of boiling grease on his bare legs. Note the\nblotches on his knee and righ foot where the new skin has formed. The\nbandaged portions are where the wounds are deep. He is baring his\nmisfortunes, but has several weeks more to suffer.\nWritten on verso of duplicate: Andrew Kulcis, age 12. Legs scalded in raid\nat San Pedro June 14th.&quot;\n\nPhotographer:\nE. F.
