I have updated our image title. In our Libraries' database at the University of WA, we actually note the following information which was not part of the info we posted to Flickr:\n\n&quot;Along the Carbon Glacier in spring. The Willis Wall in Mt. Rainier looms huge and precipitous.&quot;\n\nWould this be correct?", "authorname": "UW Digital Collections", "id": "8291911-502399915-72157624295942540", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uw_digital_images/502399915/#comment72157624172318631", "realname": "Crow has abandoned ship", "path_alias": "hoppingcrow", "author": "47432611@N07", "iconserver": "2677", "datecreate": "1276804199", "_content": "I am not sure it would be a springtime shot, based on the condition of the glacier. In spring, the Carbon appears fairly smooth-surfaced. It's not until autumn that it becomes craggy and darkens. My guess would have been that the image was taken in October after the first few snowfalls had occurred. I could be wrong about that, though.\n\nThe view presented here shows not only Willis Wall but Liberty Wall to its right and below the cloud. That's a distinction important to climbers. The ridgeline which separates the two cirques is Liberty Ridge.\n\nDo you have any idea what year the picture was taken?", "authorname": "DeForestRanger", "id": "8291911-502399915-72157624172318631", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uw_digital_images/502399915/#comment72157624297402774", "realname": "University of Washington Libraries Digital Collections", "path_alias": "uw_digital_images", "author": "8337233@N06", "iconserver": "4034", "datecreate": "1276808742", "_content": "We don't have an exact date but the image comes from the collection: Dwight Watson Photographs of Washington State, 1933-1943.", "authorname": "UW Digital Collections", "id": "8291911-502399915-72157624297402774", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "502399915"}}
