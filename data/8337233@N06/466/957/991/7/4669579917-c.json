It states:  50 years ago, March 28, 1962.  The One-Log House at Central Park, which has been serving this area as a picturesque information booth for tourists, is going to be moved to Last Spur City Park in Hoquiam.  The house, hewn from a single log by an expert chainsawyer, will have a new foundation alongside an old Rayonier Incorporated steam engine now placed permanently in the North End park.  The 12-foot log was made into a house at the Central Park  site by Dave Kenney, then employed by Whitcher Machinery Co.   Rayonier Incorporated provided the log and sponsors were the Hoquiam Chamber of Commerce and the Kiwanis Club.\nNotes:  Central Park is east of the city of Aberdeen, Washington.  The steam engine and log house are no longer there.", "authorname": "Mickey Thurman", "id": "8291911-4669579917-72157629718825977", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4669579917"}}
