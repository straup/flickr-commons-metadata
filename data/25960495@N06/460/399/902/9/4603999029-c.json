Dad wanted to revisit the place he had been when a boy at summer camp. What a horrible experience that day. I was so frightened for Daddy. We climbed without adequate clothing -- and by the time we got to the top the weather had dropped 30 degrees and it was sleeting. I knew Daddy was not going to be the same after that climb. And he wasn't. I'm glad we did it for him but god I wish it had been a balmy day!", "authorname": "beautiful my mane", "id": "25915173-4603999029-72157624281133392", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/4603999029/#comment72157624157542069", "realname": "Keene Public Library and the Historical Society of Cheshire County", "path_alias": "keenepubliclibrary", "author": "25960495@N06", "iconserver": "5442", "datecreate": "1276623305", "_content": "Ah, but on a nice day, this can be a wonderful beautiful climb!
