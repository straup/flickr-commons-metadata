A trotting course was constructed measuring just over a half-mile in length and a grandstand built which seated 1,500 spectators. Agricultural shows and races were held here for a number of years, also circuses and in 1912 the first airplane demonstration in Keene. By the time this scene was photographed, about 1905, the trolley line had been extended to service the Driving Park. Development into a residential section took place after 1913; the name Edgewood was suggested...in a contest.&quot; Edgewood was probably Keene's first housing development and is located on the southeast side of Lower Main Street. The old race track forms the course for the street around the common in the center of the development.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20080324\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n1905?\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsykmsc011\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1043", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-13 09:10:09", "lastupdate": "1276472237", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1216752866"}, "originalsecret": "1826543195", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3256", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2693609538/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607965}
