In 1893, there was a boiler explosion that killed 3 men (not 2 as the photo statement says) and wrecked 5 boilers. This photo shows Milan Cory, night fireman, and Milan Johnson, foreman of Cheshire Chair Co. This statement was on the back of one of the scenes: &quot;The picture...was taken by J.A. French, Photographer of this city, after the great boiler explosion at Beaver Mills on...May 22. The boiler house, which was entirely blown to pieces, was situated on this side of the big chimney...where the ends of the boilers which did not explode may be seen protruding from the debris. The engine house is beyond the chimney and was not thrown down. The large building at the left is occupied by the Keene Furniture Co., and that on the right by the Beaver Mills Co. The hole in the wall of the latter building is about 50 feet in width. Between that building and the boiler house was a passage way, and it was in that passage way that the killed and injured were taken out. The bodies lay near the wall of the Beaver Mills building at the farther edge of the hole in the wall as you look at the picture. The boiler which exploded was of the size of the large one shown above, and was set to the right of it. The main part of the exploded boiler lies at the foot of the chimney and a smaller part or one sheet, lies under the debris of the Beaver Mills wall. As the work of excavation and clearing away the debris has progressed, other views were made.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library and the Historical Society of Cheshire County\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20091021\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n189305\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nHS231-P641\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known copyright restrictions."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2882", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-03-24 11:10:47", "lastupdate": "1382919368", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1269443447"}, "originalsecret": "b708e86cd6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4014", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/4459425779/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607062}
