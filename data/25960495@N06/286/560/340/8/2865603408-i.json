The building was built the preceding summer on the site of the later Central Junior High School, which is now a parking lot on Winter Street. The land was given by Abijah and Azel Wilder to a board of 15 trustees and the funds were raised by subscription. It was a private institution charging tuition and there were about 200 enrolled students. The Academy was open for 17 years under ten principals, but due to lack of funds closed in 1853 and leased the building to the &quot;Associated Districts&quot; for a high school. It was sold to the &quot;Union School District&quot; in 1865 and later torn down to allow the building of the old Keene High School.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20080411\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsyksch001\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "988", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-17 11:55:34", "lastupdate": "1323139725", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1221660621"}, "originalsecret": "ec74b40ace", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3045", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2865603408/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607565}
