On June 3rd of that year the group purchased a ten rods by ten rods square tract of land on a knoll overlooking the village pond. Soon afterwards, they began construction on the two-story white-clapboard structure which still stands there today. Although the identity of the architect and builder are uncertain, we do know that the Academy building was intentionally designed with two front doors to provide separate entrances for the male and female students.\n\n&quot;The Odd Fellows officially purchased the Academy building on September 5, 1891 for the sum of $600.&quot; &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.marlow-nh.org/Clubs_Organizations/I.O.O.F/ioof.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.marlow-nh.org/Clubs_Organizations/I.O.O.F/ioof.htm</a>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "25915173-4626910569-72157624108920452", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/4626910569/#comment72157624022915329", "realname": "Keene Public Library and the Historical Society of Cheshire County", "path_alias": "keenepubliclibrary", "author": "25960495@N06", "iconserver": "5442", "datecreate": "1274966913", "_content": "Hi Sasafrass - It sure looks like the same building.
