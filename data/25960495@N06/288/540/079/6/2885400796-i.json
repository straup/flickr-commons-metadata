The D.A.R. marker is visible. This was one of the early roads laid out by the proprietors by 1740 for travel from the Town Street through the lands of Aaron Hall and others to Seth Heaton's property and beyond to Beech Hill. It was first mentioned in 1754. In 1799, the Third N.H. Turnpike was organized and ran from Bellows Falls VT to the Massachusetts border and traveled through the Boston Road on its way to Marlborough. The DAR stone marker placed on its southeast corner noted that it was the Boston Road, an old route to Boston. \nDown this road the patriots marched in 1775 in response to the Lexington alarm.\nIt was named after Thomas Baker who established the first tannery in tow and lived on the street. In 1913 when a new sewer was being laid on the street, an old corduroy road was found beneath the street's surface. These roads were formed by laying logs side by side across a low, swampy area on its route.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20080418\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsyksts002\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1326", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-22 13:12:08", "lastupdate": "1276472245", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1222270769"}, "originalsecret": "f9e276cba3", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3215", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2885400796/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607488}
