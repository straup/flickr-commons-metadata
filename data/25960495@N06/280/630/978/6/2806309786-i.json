The Bank Block was built by the Cheshire Provident Institution. The construction &quot;was hampered by an earthquake which occurred when they were nearly completed. Fortunately there was no serious damage...Below the ground were found logs and tree stumps preserved by the moisture of the old Town Brook, some of which were thought to date from early geologic periods; similar wood was found elsewhere in the Square during building construction.&quot;\nThere was a fire in 1934 after which the building was remodeled and two upper floors were removed. \n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20071116\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n1870\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsykbdg049\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1048", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-27 10:38:36", "lastupdate": "1276472240", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1219937352"}, "originalsecret": "58b92dc932", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3208", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2806309786/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607750}
