The original Mountain House was built in 1858 . In 1861, a two story house was added to the original stone structure by Moses Cudworth of Rindge NH. He also built a wagon shed and would stable the horses of people who rode up and then hiked the rest of the way. George and Abbie Rice acquired the site in 1866 and opened a much larger 3 story hotel, which burned down that year. New owners in 1868 built a two story building. After several more ownership changes, another owner changed the name to Half Way House in 1916. It was bought by a local association in 1945 and operated as a public property until it burned to the ground in 1954.\nMonadnock is said to be the second most climbed mountain in the world, after Mt. Fuji. It is 3,165 feet tall and stands alone above the surrounding landscape. The geological term &quot;monadnock&quot; is taken from this mountain and means an isolated, erosin-resistant mountain that rises abruptly from its surroundings.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20080407\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographic postcards\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsykscn065\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1031", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-22 13:04:49", "lastupdate": "1276472241", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1220984982"}, "originalsecret": "ea048fb470", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3186", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2843832258/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607706}
