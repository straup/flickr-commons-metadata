Asa, formerly a minister from Salem Mass., became a lawyer in Keene the same year the house was built. He died in 1787 at age 41 and was the town clerk at that time. \nHis wife Mary supported her five small children by opening the house as a tavern. Her youngest child, Cynthia, born in this house, became the mother of Henry David Thoreau. \nFrom 1894 to 1910 it was a lunch business operated by Peter G. Marrion. At first the customers were served through the windows while standing under a canopy over a raised platform. By Sept.1894, the business was so prosperous, the interior was opened and customers sat around a counter. In the picture, the sign under the canopy says &quot;Hot Coffee and Sandwiches&quot;. The railroad station was not used after 1910.\nThe house was at times a boarding house, a lunch business frequented by Rudyard Kipling, the Crystal Restaurant, and for many years was a restaurant called Henry Davids. It is now Margueritas, a Mexican restaurant.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20071101\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n1894-1910?\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsykhse044\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2394", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-08 14:38:41", "lastupdate": "1389140181", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1211399834"}, "originalsecret": "5fe64766e6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3199", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2512252810/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389608748}
