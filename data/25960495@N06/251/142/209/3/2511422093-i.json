Built circa 1750 by Seth Heaton, one of the original proprietors of Upper Ashuelot. It is located at 500 Marlboro St. and has been extensively remodeled. The house was built across the pathway from Heaton's first house, a log cabin which was burnt by the Indians in 1747. Seth Heaton spent the summers of 1734 and 1735 in Upper Ashuelot - no settler spent the winter in the new township until 1736. The summer of 1736, he along with Nathan Blake and William Smeed, built a log cabin. They prepared to spend the winter of 1736 there but were forced to return to Massachusetts by February. The next spring, Heaton cleared land and set out an orchard. Several years later he killed an Indian who was trying to cut down one of the fruit trees. The Indians retaliated by burning the log cabin in 1747. Two years later, he replaced the cabin with this home.\nFour of Seth's sons were Revolutionary soldiers. He left the house to his youngest son, Samuel when he died in 1787.\n\n<b>PUBLISHER</b>\nKeene Public Library\n\n<b>DATE DIGITAL</b>\n20071101\n\n<b>DATE ORIGINAL</b>\n\n<b>RESOURCE TYPE</b>\nphotographs\n\n<b>FORMAT</b>\nimage/jpg\n\n<b>RESOURCE IDENTIFIER</b>\nhsykhse043\n\n<b>RIGHTS MANAGMENT</b>\nNo known restriction on publication."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2075", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-04-08 14:37:40", "lastupdate": "1354655451", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1211399833"}, "originalsecret": "af41f99f92", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2306", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2511422093/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389608753}
