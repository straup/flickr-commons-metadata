The vehicles depicted range from the late '20s to the very early '40s. The two-tone Chevy fastback (fifth from the right, in center of street) is the clearest indication of the date of this photo.  It is a style introduced for the 1941 model year. While it was continued postwar into 1948 I see nothing that would clearly support a theory that this was either during the war or shortly thereafter.  Gasoline was severely rationed and tires were virtually unavailable during the war.  This virtually curtailed private vehicle usage.  Thus I would think that this photo was most likely taken within the year preceding Pearl Harbor!\n\n<i>[ <a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/tags/automobiles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">via Keene and Cheshire County (NH) Historical Photos's tag 'automobiles' on flickriver</a> &nbsp;--<a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/63085612@N00/popular-interesting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jamu98765</a> ]</i>", "authorname": "jamu98765", "id": "25915173-2652117309-72157625095184513", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/keenepubliclibrary/2652117309/#comment72157625240534664", "realname": "Keene Public Library and the Historical Society of Cheshire County", "path_alias": "keenepubliclibrary", "author": "25960495@N06", "iconserver": "5442", "datecreate": "1288034741", "_content": "Thanks again for the info.
