The function of this part of the building is not clear.  There are vines clinging to parts of the building. \nThere is a man looking towards the building and a couple(?) of faintly exposed human figures in the foreground.  This makes me wonder how long the exposure took.\nIn front of part of the building there appears to be a large collection of plants in pots arranged for viewing.", "authorname": "Ian BC North", "id": "26129095-2925974527-72157608158596434", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2925974527"}}
