The groom was Robert Miller, eldest son of Rev. David Miller, a former minister of First Armagh Presbyterian Church and grandson of R.G. McCrum of Milford. The bride was Stella Lawless whose father was resident medical superintendent of what was then still known as the Armagh and District Lunatic Asylum and whose mother was Girl Guide Commissioner for County Armagh. Indeed, the bride had been Captain of the First Armagh Company for some years. The wedding took place at St. Patrick's Church of Ireland Cathedral on 2nd January 1924 and the reception was at the Asylum where this photograph was taken on the steps of the R.M.S.'s house."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1140", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-16 14:38:18", "lastupdate": "1376035928", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1288689947"}, "originalsecret": "4801307ffa", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4104", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/proni/5138760539/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
