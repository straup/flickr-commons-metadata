Sailor suits were common garb for boys.  I think it is a grouping of six sets of twins, three identical, three fraternal.  The identicals are the two seated on the right, the two with sailor collars trimmed with stripes and short hair: and the two either side of the boy in the middle.   The non-identicals are the two at the back with Eton collars, the two seated on the left, and the other more mis-matched pair - a large boy standing back left, and a small boy seated on the high stand in a velvet suit.", "authorname": "Lenore F", "id": "54371041-6544111135-72157633099357801", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/proni/6544111135/#comment72157633099367081", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "61364329@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1364384904", "_content": "I'd be inclined to retitle this photo &quot;Early Twin Study&quot;.", "authorname": "Lenore F", "id": "54371041-6544111135-72157633099367081", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6544111135"}}
