I just noted on a different photo that dealing with archival photographs is difficult because often the person who took the photo wrote inaccurate information on the back.  These particular photos had multiple spellings of &quot;Walcheren&quot; and we maintain inaccurate notations along with a correction note.  However, I will change the titles of these Flickr versions while maintaining the English spelling of Scheldt.
