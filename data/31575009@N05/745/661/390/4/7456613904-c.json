The camp held over 1,300 German, Austrian, and Turkish prisoners, though the majority were of ethnic Ukrainian descent, whose homeland was part of Austria\u2013Hungary at that time. Prisoners were employed in the construction of buildings and clearing of land for a government experimental farm on the west side on the Kapuskasing River. Isolation provided ideal security for the minimum security camp as the railway was the only access to the remote location. Prisoners who attempted to escape into the bush were turned back by endless muskeg and clouds of mosquitoes or minus-40 degree temperatures in winter. In 1917, most were paroled to help relieve labour shortages. Afterwards the camp was used briefly for prisoner-of-war and political radicals until its closure in 1920.[4]\n\nA small cemetery is all that remains of the internment camp near the Kapuskasing Airport where victims of the 1918 influenza epidemic were laid to rest. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Kapuskasing Internment Camp's role in Ontario's heritage.[9]\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapuskasing#Internment_camp\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapuskasing#Internment_camp</a>", "authorname": "oaktree_brian_1976", "id": "31569669-7456613904-72157631330954774", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "7456613904"}}
