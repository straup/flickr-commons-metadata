I think it's pre 1957 and pre-Malaya's Independence too. This statement on the last page &quot;can now build up a common loyalty to the Federation of Malaya.&quot; perhaps implies the coming Independence. \n\nIt is however a significant album as it imagines the British territories of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, North Borneo and Sarawak together - collectively and pre-empts the new country-to-be 'Malaysia' before the idea of 'Malaysia' was first publicly announced by Malaya (and Malaysia's) first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman in 1961. \n\nMalaysia came to be in 1963 by signatory territories of Malaya, North Borneo (now Sabah), Sarawak and Singapore (expelled in 1965) and Brunei opted not to be part of Malaysia. Anyway, very timely for our nation's 50th anniversary next year in 2013.
