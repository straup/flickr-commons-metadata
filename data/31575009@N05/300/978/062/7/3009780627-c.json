Rob Roy was hauling the  5pm Mail Train from Milford when ran into the rear of the 1.37pm Cattle Train from Carmarthen causing the locomotive to over-ride two cattle wagons and resting partially on the back of the third cattle wagon. \nThe Driver and Fireman of the mail train were not injured but three Drovers and the Guard were killed on the cattle train plus five Drovers who were injured. \nThe cattle train had stalled on the gradient due to bad rail adhesion. Both trains were working on a Time Interval System of approx 20min intervals but owing to the continued stalling of the cattle train the mail train caught up and collided with the train. It was recommended that a Block System of Telegraph should be introduced between Awre Jct and Bullo Pill..", "authorname": "simontheeditor", "id": "31569669-3009780627-72157631886605262", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3009780627"}}
