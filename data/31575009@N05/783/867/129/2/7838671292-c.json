Cheung Chau had already been settled by people from other places in Southern China; for example, Hoklo, they are mainly fishing people; Hakka people; Chiu Chau; and Yue Ca. The island slowly evolved into a commercial hub with merchants selling supplies to the local fishing people, boat repair and fishing gear as well as the place to do business for fishing people and small farmers of other nearby islands like Lantau Island.\n\nFrom 2000, a spate of suicide cases (most of them by &quot;burning charcoal&quot;) took place inside rental holiday homes on the island. Hong Kong Chinese-language newspapers soon dubbed the island &quot;Death Island&quot; and stories concerning apparitions appeared in the wake of news about the succeeding suicides. In 2005 a local councillor Lam Kit-sing proposed a &quot;suicide theme-park&quot; to be built in order to capitalise on the island's now macabre reputation. Those plans were quickly ridiculed and subsequently rejected. Soon after, the choice of Cheung Chau for would-be suicides tailed off.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838671292-72157634835591576", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838671292"}}
