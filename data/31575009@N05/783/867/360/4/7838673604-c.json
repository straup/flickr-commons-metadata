During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Kowloon City was a part of Koon Fu Cheung (\u5b98\u5bcc\u5834), which was a part of salt yard governed by Chinese officials.\n\nPart of the district was the location of the original Kowloon Walled City, erected during the Qing Dynasty. This is now Kowloon Walled City Park. The former Kai Tak International Airport was also located in the district.\n\nIn 1982, Hong Kong was divided into 18 administrative districts, and Kowloon City and its neighbouring areas, such as Hung Hom, belong to the Kowloon City District since then.\n\nPrior to 1998, a strict building height restriction was imposed in Kowloon City to minimize the hazards of air traffic commuting through the Kai Tak Airport. The closure of Kai Tak as a result of the opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport lifted the height restriction, and high-rise apartments started to appear.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838673604-72157634835519808", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838673604"}}
