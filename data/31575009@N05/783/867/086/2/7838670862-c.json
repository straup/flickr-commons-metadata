It joins north with Urmston Road. Kap Shui Mun Bridge spans the channel.\n\nThe original Chinese name of Kap Shui Mun is kap shui mun (\u6025\u6c34\u9580), the gate of fast-moving water. This exactly describes the current of the channel. The name 'fast-moving water' was associated with accidents for ships and boats. To remove this malign influence, it was renamed to a title with similar sound, k'ap shui mun (\u6c72\u6c34\u9580), meaning 'water-fetching gate'. For Chinese, water represents fortune and wealth.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838670862-72157634829064991", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838670862"}}
