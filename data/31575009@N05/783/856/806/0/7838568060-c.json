Photo very similar to City of Victoria, 3rd ed 1999, p.14. Murray Barrack in the foreground. St John's Cathedral on the left. City Hall near the water front in the centre. Only the praya (Des Voeux Road) was seen. Not much seen of the Central reclamation in 1890. So this could have been taken before 1890.", "authorname": "Paed Ortho", "id": "31569669-7838568060-72157636212134626", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838568060"}}
