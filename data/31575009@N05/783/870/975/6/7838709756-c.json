Most of them were fishermen, who worked around the area near Hung Shing Temple overlooking the entire harbour. Hung Shing Ye, the God of the Sea, was one of the deities worshiped by the locals.\n\nWith the growth of the British Hong Kong administration, centred in old Victoria, modern Central, Wan Chai attracted those on the fringes of society, such as coolies, who came to live on Queen's Road East. A focal point of development was Spring Gardens, a red-light zone. By the 1850s the area was already becoming a Chinese residential area", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838709756-72157634835861694", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838709756"}}
