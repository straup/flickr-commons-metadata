Construction started in 1851, eight years after Hong Kong was declared a British colony, and took four years to complete. The first governor to live there was Sir John Bowring, the fourth governor of the territory. The last one was the last governor, Chris Patten.\n\nIn 1891, an annex was added to the house for social functions (namely the Ballroom). During the Japanese occupation during World War II (1941\u20131945), it was occupied by the Japanese Military Governor. The form of the building changed to a hybrid Japanese/neoclassical image by Seichi Fujimura in 1944, primarily through the addition of a tower and roof elements.\n\nGovernment House also housed the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1855 to the 1930s. The Council used the ballroom from 1891 onward.\n\nAfter the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the House became a reception for ceremonies (such as the conferring of Honours and formal banquets). Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief Executive did not reside in Government House.\n\nDonald Tsang, the second Chief Executive moved into Government House in January 2006, following extensive renovations. The Standard criticised that the renovation cost was estimated at HK$14.5 million, including a sum of HK$300,000 allocated to a new fish pond designed to accommodate Tsang's collection of koi.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838456528-72157634833100982", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838456528"}}
