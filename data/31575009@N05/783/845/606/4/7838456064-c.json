The bay to the left of this should be the sea which is now Victoria Park. Further out you may imagine a small island amongst the ships called Kellet Island, which is now land adjacent to the Cross Harbour Tunnel entrance. The hill behind it is the hills in North Point, like Fortress Hill.", "authorname": "Paed Ortho", "id": "31569669-7838456064-72157635221974321", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838456064"}}
