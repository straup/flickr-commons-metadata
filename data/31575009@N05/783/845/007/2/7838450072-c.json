It was built in 1865 and destroyed by an American air raid in 1944, during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong.[1]\nThe building was located at the upper junction of Zetland Street and Ice House Street, where a Hong Kong Electric sub-station stands today. The building was designed by the Surveyor-General, Charles St George Cleverly, who also designed Government House. The building took its name from Zetland Lodge No. 525, the Masonic lodge that built it, and that was itself named for Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland, Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England from 1844 to 1870.[1]\nZetland Lodge remained in use until the Second World War when it was severely damaged during an air raid.", "authorname": "szivhk", "id": "31569669-7838450072-72157634982153800", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838450072"}}
