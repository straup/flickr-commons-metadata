It was built in 1574 during the Ming Dynasty, and was called Chik Chuen Wai (Chinese: \u7a4d\u5b58\u570d) at the time. It was originally made up of 16 families, Wai (\u97cb), Chan (\u9673), Ng (\u5433), Yeung (\u694a), Wong (\u9ec3), Lee (\u674e), Hui (\u8a31), Cheng (\u912d), Tong (\u5510), Yuen (\u8881), Yau (\u6e38), Lam (\u6797), Lok (\u99f1), Tam (\u8b5a), Mok (\u83ab) and Choy (\u8521).\n\nThe Wai family, being the largest family, is thought to be the direct descendants of the famous founder general of the Han Dynasty, Han Xin, who purportedly fled there to escape executions ordered by Emperor Gao of Han's empress Empress L\u00fc Zhi. The Han descendants changed their surname into Wai by splitting the word Han (\u97d3) in two halves and took up the character on the right hand side.\n\nThe Cheng family, on the other hand, originated from a place called Xingyang in Zhengzhou, Henan which is the place where Chang'e supposedly flew to the Moon. It is also the birthplace of Li Shangyin, one of the most famous poets in the late Tang Dynasty.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838641240-72157634828390295", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838641240"}}
