Britain owned Hong Kong Island in perpetuity but it had a limited 99-year lease on Kowloon and the New Territories. New Territories village elders were and still are very powerful. Back in the 1960s, the British colonial government offered all N.T. villages the right to emigrate to the United Kingdom, The villagers who took up this offer had to give up their land. To make the deal sweeeter for the villages, the British colonial government promised that if any male descendent of the villager ever decides to return to the NT to live, he would be entitled to a parcel of land. It's called the &quot;Small House Policy&quot;. It's a huge problem today because land is running out in NT and even worse..many &quot;sons of NTemigrants&quot; return to HK to claim their piece of land only to sell  it off for astronomical prices developers! Parts of the New Territories today is a huge mess because of this along with uncontrolled development.", "authorname": "MaxMediaAsia", "id": "31569669-7838932002-72157632606203163", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7838932002"}}
