These methods however were unable to support rapid growth of population since 1841. Diseases were caused by polluted water.\n\nThe Hong Kong Government needed an urgent solution to the problem. Thus, it prepared a reward of 1,000 pounds to anyone who provided a solution to disease on 14 October 1859. The colonial government also allocated a budget of 25,000 pounds for the project.\n\nOn 29 February 1860, S. B. Rawling, a clerk from Royal Engineers suggested the construction of a dam across the valley of Pokfulam to collect rain water.\n\nThe reservoir was completed in 1863. The construction did not meet the needs of the population because of budget-cuts, which left the dam to be far from adequate.\n\nAnother reservoir above the original was built to meet the needs of the growing colony in 1877.", "authorname": "hphbhk", "id": "31569669-7838628286-72157634834698796", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7838628286"}}
