It may have come from the above plane. It is not clear why the plane above was abandoned, whether it was due to an engine malfunction or damage from gunfire from the ground - which is possible because some of the aerial shots are taken from only 200ft above ground", "authorname": "rick.davies@gmail.com", "id": "31569669-5418473145-72157628050927146", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5418473145"}}
