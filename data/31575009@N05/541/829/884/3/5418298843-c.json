This was the only German naval warship stationed in East Africa at the outbreak of war in 1914.  The ship left Dar es Salaam on 31 July just before war was declared. After taking on coal from the German collier &quot;Somali&quot; she entered the Rufiji River. On 20 September she sailed to Zanzibar and shelled the British light cruiser &quot;Pegasus&quot; which was docked there for repairs and destroyed it. The &quot;Koenigsberg&quot; then returned to the Rufiji and travelled some 20 miles upriver in order to evade the British ships in pursuit. The ship remained a potential threat to British activities so attempts were made by the very elementary aircraft of the time to bomb it but without success. In July 1915 two shallow draught monitor gunboats, the &quot;Severn&quot; and the &quot;Mersey&quot;, were brought out from Britain.  They were able to attack the ship with shellfire and damaged it so badly that the German captain chose to blow it up. The Germans took away some of the guns from the ship and used them for the rest of the campaign.", "authorname": "tazamapichadfbleb", "id": "31569669-5418298843-72157627768601635", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5418298843/#comment72157628772529745", "realname": "Paul Jackson", "path_alias": null, "author": "92943860@N00", "iconserver": "4", "datecreate": "1326012464", "_content": "Yes, definitely the Koenigsberg\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/53964533@N04/5170140448/]", "authorname": "ART NAHPRO", "id": "31569669-5418298843-72157628772529745", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5418298843"}}
