There is an almost identical photo published in Douglas Jardine's book The Mad Mullah of Somaliland taken before the RAF bombed it in 1920-21. The figure in the foreground is likely to be of  a member of the Dolbahantur tribe, and the Nur Mohamed  subsection whose watering area was around the fort.", "authorname": "bimbashi1", "id": "31569669-5418114971-72157626550188515", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "5418114971"}}
