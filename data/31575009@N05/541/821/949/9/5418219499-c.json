The people I recognize in the picture are (1) HIS MAJESTY THE FON OF FONTEM  DEFANG of Bangwa\n(2) HER ROYAL HIGHNESS  MAFUA NKENG, the MAFUA OF FONTEM\n(3) J.O FIELD who was the British Commissioner in those days, probably resident in Nigeria &amp; who usually came to Cameroon for visiting.\n\nI am trying to find out the other people standing next to the Fon.  By the Bangwa tradition, the Fon Of Fontem never shakes hand with people and that might have been why the commissioner is found shaking hand only with the Fon's Mafua after he might have finished greeting the king.    \nFONTEM  Kitts", "authorname": "kittsfontem", "id": "31569669-5418219499-72157626062040002", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5418219499/#comment72157629908405177", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77677628@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1335491222", "_content": "Interesting", "authorname": "p.tazanu", "id": "31569669-5418219499-72157629908405177", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5418219499"}}
