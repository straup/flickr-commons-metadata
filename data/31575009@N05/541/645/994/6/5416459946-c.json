I attended this school from 1961 to 1963, and one of my housemothers was Marion Harbourn, and I believe the woman in the center of the line of people is her.  Maybe they all just look like I remember my teachers looking,,,it IS 50 years ago!!!", "authorname": "daviadzao", "id": "31569669-5416459946-72157626318447095", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5416459946"}}
