It also had very fine dining. It had an Olympic size swimming pool and was situated close to the beach. I believe that after independence from Portugal it was converted into army barracks. I could look up my mother's diary if you would like more information", "authorname": "Liz Finnie", "id": "31569669-5418902088-72157631632732583", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5418902088"}}
