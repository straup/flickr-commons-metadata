My research has led me to believe that it is the carved figurehead of the British sailing ship Loanda that was wrecked on the Georgetown shore during the great hurricane of 1898. The wreck of the ship was exposed by the sea  some 10 years ago and recently I was sent a photo of a painting of the ship clearly showing the same figurehead. \n\nSee my article <a href=\"http://www.caribbeancompass.com/online/aprilcompass_online.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.caribbeancompass.com/online/aprilcompass_online.pdf</a>  (page 19).", "authorname": "The National Archives UK", "id": "31569669-7643191318-72157631387163686", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "7643191318"}}
