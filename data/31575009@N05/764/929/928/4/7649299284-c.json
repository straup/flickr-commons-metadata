The 2 storey building on the left now houses Joseph (Joe) Bahri's store. They sell curtains and all types of bags and the Bahri family lives in the upper level. They are immigrant Syrians/ Lebanese.\nMr. Bahri used to teach Integrated Science and Chemistry at St. Joseph's Academy before transferring to Antigua Girls' High School. He was the first moderator for the Junior Science Quizz series on t.v. that started in the late 80's, around 1989 or so. He was an excellent teacher!\n\nTo the right of this building is where Gigi Plaza is now located which includes Happy Kids Store and Cameo.\n\nThe building in the right foreground now houses Paris Shoes.", "authorname": "t_richards", "id": "31569669-7649299284-72157631562512394", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/7649299284/#comment72157631581657802", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "87446692@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1348153696", "_content": "Top photo is High and thames street.
