Varanasi has always been cosmopolitan, partly due to its sacredness.  Firstly, there's a fairly large number of (for instance) Bengali, Marathi and Tamil speaking people in the city, and their numbers must have been higher in the past because of different migration patterns.  Secondly, businesses catering to certain linguistic groups usually keep their boards in that language.  The stereotypical Gujarati is known not only for his business skills but also his charity, and a pilgrim from rural Gujarat wouldn't be able to read in other scripts.  \n\nIn fact one can still find many <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/22744779@N08/2182674419/\">signboards in Varanasi</a> in Indian languages other than Hindi (e. g.
