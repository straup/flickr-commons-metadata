He was a war artist that supplied work to a company based in Cambridge Circus, London during the war who were called War Artists and Illustrators.\nMy father also worked for them and used deliver artwork to a section of the Ministry of Information who,at the time, were based at Senate House, London. Many of the artwoks were bought for PR and Morale purposes, many of them were not bought and were then discarded by War Artists and Illustrators. Luckily my father managed to salvage a few original artworks and I now have several by W.Krogman and also an artist called R.W. Jobson later to work on three British Comic Book Annuals incorporating the character Captain Space Kingley.
