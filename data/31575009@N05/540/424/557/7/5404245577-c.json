They were originally part of the Southern Sotho.  Driven from their homeland in what is now the Free State province of South Africa during the Nguni migrations of the early 19th century, they eventually found themselves cornered between the Zambezi and Chobe rivers, where they established their dominance.  David Livingstone encountered them there in 1851 and became friendly with them.  The resulting long association led to the arrival of a number of them as porters with Livingstone at the initial U.M.C.A. mission at Magomero  in 1861.  They were with him when he first sighted &quot;Lake Nyassa&quot;.  The Makololo then followed Livingstone to the Lower Shire where they remained and established their dominance.", "authorname": "John.Kemp1", "id": "31569669-5404245577-72157626294707900", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404245577"}}
