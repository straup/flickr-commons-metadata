However, 68, 69 &amp; 71 are defiantly Wynberg, Cape Town. Winburg and Wynberg sounded the same to the photographer. There are no mountains like that anywhere near Winburg in the Free State. No. 71 location: Pretoria is incorrect. The Modder River and Winburg are closer to Bloemfontein which is in the Free State.", "authorname": "Liz Finnie", "id": "31569669-5408759768-72157631632805986", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5408759768"}}
