There is one of two possibilities.   Firstly the photo comes from a collection of photos covering the other areas or secondly it may refer to where the folk in the photo hail from.   All the locations mentioned are in Kenya (then and now) except for Liverpool.   There are a number of LIverpools world-wide but I suspect the reference is to Liverpool in the UK.  Nevertheless the location should only be Mombasa otherwise it is too confusing for catalouging purposes.", "authorname": "PigaPicha1", "id": "31569669-5404458829-72157626078515764", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404458829"}}
