He also held an appointment as magistrate.  When his agricultural venture failed and government retrenchment resulted in the abolition of his post he left for Africa.  He was offered a post in the Gold Coast (Ghana), but preferred to travel and hunt in Central Africa.  During a year with the British South Africa Company he acquired experience in making treaties.  Harry Johnston wrote (\u201cBritish Central Africa\u201d, p89) that in 1889 \u201cOn my way up the Shire to Blantyre I\u2026encountered Mr. Alfred Sharpe, who was travelling up the river in his own boat\u201d.  In need of someone to represent him in areas that were not on his route while making treaties, Johnston had Sharpe appointed Vice-Consul in 1891.  Consul in 1894, Commissioner in 1896,  Sharpe took an important part in subduing slavery in the country, one result of which was the naming of Fort Sharpe, near Liwonde, after him.  He eventually become Governor, May 1908-April 1910.", "authorname": "John.Kemp1", "id": "31569669-5404288499-72157626123525483", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404288499"}}
