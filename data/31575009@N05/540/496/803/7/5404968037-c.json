If you look at the the image National Archives has it is to the left of the rocks facing the same light house  in the Suez Canal with the same 3 mast Bark upper left hand corner, however there is a two masted steamer behind it. The Image University of Southern California has for the Basel Mission, the photographer stood to the right of your photographer which brought the Rocks in the foreground closer to the center of his photograph. \n\n- The fact that University of Southern California's photograph has the same three masted bark you do upper left corner suggests this may have been shot the same day. The newer two masted steamer behind it is missing from their photograph but &quot;Arnoux - lighthouse of Port Said.&quot; is to the right as well.\n\n- another difference between the two photographs is University of Southern California's photograph is writen on in cursive, while  National Archives is written in print. \n\n- Although theirs does say &quot;Arnoux 44&quot; in print and yours says &quot;Arnoux 15&quot; in print. The &quot;n&quot; in &quot;Arnoux&quot; appears similar. These may be of originally of the same set of photographs.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bmpix.org/bmpix/controller/view/impa-m42404.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bmpix.org/bmpix/controller/view/impa-m42404.html</a>\n\n &quot;Arnoux - lighthouse of Port Said.&quot; Basel Mission in the Suez Canal. I have pasted the info from University of Southern California image in their collections. It may be worth contacting them. I have pasted info from their site for simplicity.\n\nCheers,\n\nBobby Ronayne\n\n\n=============================================================\n\n\n[collection] Historical Photographs from the Basel Mission\n[album] &quot;Journey to China and India.&quot;\n[repository] mission 21 / Basel Mission\n\n&quot;Arnoux - lighthouse of Port Said.&quot;\n\n* About this series \u00bb\n* View other items in this series \u00bb\n\nDescription\n\nAnnotation translation: &quot;Arnoux 44.&quot;\nAnnotation: &quot;Arnoux 44.&quot;\nTitle:\n\n[translation] &quot;Arnoux - lighthouse of Port Said.&quot;\nAlternate Title:\n\n[original caption] &quot;Arnoux - Phare de Port Said.&quot;\nNames &amp; Dates\nCreated:\n\n1861/1890\nCreator:\n\n[photo studio] Arnoux, Hippolyte, Port Said, Egypt\nPublisher:\n\n[host] University of Southern California.
