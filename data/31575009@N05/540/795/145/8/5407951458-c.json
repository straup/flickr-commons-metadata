Presumably these bridges were a part of the construction of the 'Uganda Railway' which originally ran entirely in Kenya, from Nairobi to Kisumu, then known as Port Florence, and was opened in 1903. Goods were trans-shipped from there to Port Bell on Lake Victoria in Uganda. The northern route into Uganda by rail, did not reach Kampala until 1931.\n\nAs mentioned in a comment on another image, the location can be confirmed by the mileage. But it is not far enough to be in Uganda - the entire length to Kisumu was 600 miles from Mombasa. All the images of the construction of the Uganda railway with notations of under 600 miles and/or dated before the northern route was built are therefore pictures of locations in Kenya, whether or not the name is recognised, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway</a> and references therein.", "authorname": "nickjewitt", "id": "31569669-5407951458-72157626039563748", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5407951458"}}
