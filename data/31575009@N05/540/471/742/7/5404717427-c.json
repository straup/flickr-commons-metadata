The party was travelling down the Rufiji River from Utete in the District Commssioner's boat the &quot;Kambare&quot; (mudfish). After the first day, calling at Ndundu and Msomeni, where barazas were held, the night was spent in camp at Kikale.   At dawn next morning the level of the river was exceptionally low, so that there was a wide stretch of black slimy malodorous deep mud between the river bank and the boat. In order to cross this the people provided three dugout canoes with which to transport the Governor's party. The picture shows the first dugout, containing the Governor in front and the Provincial Commissioner, Mr GT (&quot;Peter&quot;) Bell,OBE, behind.  A second dugout following behind in the same manner carried Lady Turnbull, the District Commissioner Utete, Mr John Young, and the Governor's Private Secretary, Mr David Le Breton. \n+", "authorname": "tazamapichadfbleb", "id": "31569669-5404717427-72157627886412136", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404717427"}}
