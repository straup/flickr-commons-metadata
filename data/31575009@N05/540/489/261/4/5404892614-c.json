Captain Maguire, at Harry Johnston\u2019s request, arrived in B.C.A. in mid-1891 with troops from India and immediately joined Johnston in a campaign against Yao slavers.  It was during this campaign that the original Fort Johnston, on the east bank of the Shire opposite Mponda\u2019s village, was built.  It was from there that Maguire left on the African Lakes Corporation ship &quot;Domira&quot;, which had been requisitioned for military service, to search for two dhows of the slaver Makanjira, on the southeast lake shore, that had escaped an earlier raid.  The dhows were found near Makanjira\u2019s main town and a force landed to destroy them.  They were attacked by a strong force of Makanjira and in retreating to the &quot;Domira&quot; (which had been blown by a storm onto a sandbank), after seeing the other members of  the landing party safely back to the ship, Maguire was shot in the head.", "authorname": "John.Kemp1", "id": "31569669-5404892614-72157626110921803", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404892614"}}
