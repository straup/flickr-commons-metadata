(Eldoret did not exist at that stage nor the Uasin Gishu farms.)  Please refer to my Flickr upload Ndalat.   Indeed the highest hill is Ndalat - sometimes written as Eldalat (in the early days) and indeed the Uasin Gishu Plateau  used to be written as the Guas Ngishu Plateau named.   Ndalat is the highest hill.  The one nearby is Kakeptui.   The caption does not read as &quot;Mle&quot; but as &quot;Mts&quot; - short for mountains.   In East Africa because the mountains are so high other high protrusions which in other countries would be referred to as mountains are referred to as hills.   The Turbo-Kipkarren hills and Sergoit Rock are visible from Burnt Forest.   The early explorers (and I would not hesitate to say other early travellers) would have used these hills as bearings.   Further in the background on clear days one would be able to see the Cheranganis and Mt Elgon.", "authorname": "PigaPicha1", "id": "31569669-5404946948-72157625947110381", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5404946948/#comment72157625965190083", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "59375758@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1298162630", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/59375758@N06/5453075572/#/]", "authorname": "PigaPicha1", "id": "31569669-5404946948-72157625965190083", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5404946948/#comment72157626090744534", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "59375758@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1298163325", "_content": "Looking out towards the Turbo-Kipkarren Hills just outside Eldoret on the Eldoret-Kipkarren Road just past the junction of the Eldoret-Kisumu Road.

We farmed somewhere where those hills are located - just below the Sorora Hills.  (I do not know if the Sorora Hills are visible or not hence my request for others to identify the individual hills among that group of hills).   From 1950-1962 we farmed in Burnt Forest from where one could overlook the Uasin Gishu district and with it the collection of those hills as well as the lone Sergoit Rock and behind it the Cheranganis and Mt Elgon.   I was however an Eldoret local from 1950-1956 when I attended the Hill School, Eldoret as a boarder.  The new campus shown below was built after the tragic fire in 1951 in which Uganda pupil John Lattin perished.   You can see the Turbo-Kipkarren hills in the background and so you most likely would have seen them from Eldoret in 1987.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/59375758@N06/5513843387/]", "authorname": "PigaPicha1", "id": "31569669-5404946948-72157626235575376", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5404946948/#comment72157627269560243", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66244718@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1312902611", "_content": "My familiy was raised on the arm (1946 - 1972) called Kakeptui that encompassed the Kakeptui Hills - we looked out on to Ndalat.
