One of these groups settled in what became Matabeleland in southern Zimbabwe under the leadership of Mzilikazi, but many others continued north across the Zambezi under chief Zwangendaba in 1835.  Some of the latter settled in what is now eastern Zambia and central Malawi, but many went still farther north.  Although one group travelled as far as the area south of Lake Victoria, the greatest number settled near the southern shores of Lake Tanganyika.  After the death of Zwangendaba in the late 1840s quarrels broke out and two groups broke away and moved back southward, one to the west and one to the east of Lake Malawi, where they laid waste to the lake shores.", "authorname": "John.Kemp1", "id": "31569669-5404852952-72157626278202352", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404852952"}}
