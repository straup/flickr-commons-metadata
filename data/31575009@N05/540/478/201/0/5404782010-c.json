On August 13th, 1914, the Hermann von Wissmann was up on a slipway on the beach at Sphinxhaven (now Liuli in Tanzania) for repairs and was disabled by the only one of many shells fired at her by the Guendolen to strike its target.   Her captain wasn't even aware that war had been declared.  A first-hand account is given in the Nyasaland Journal, Vol. X, No. 2, pp 25-31, 1957, by G.M. Sanderson.  These photos were probably taken in 1898, the year she was shipped out from Rennie's at Greenwich.  She made her first voyage in May 1899.", "authorname": "John.Kemp1", "id": "31569669-5404782010-72157626639090712", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404782010"}}
