The steamer's hull was used for many years as a ferry at Liwonde and in 1966 the hull was moved to Monkey Bay for use as a landing stage. Apparently the hull was still there in the early 70s.\nHard to identify the other two vessels. They appear to be propellor driven so the possibilities are  LIVINGSTONE, DOMIRA, PIONEER or ADVENTURE perhaps the QUEEN VICTORIA?", "authorname": "degahk", "id": "31569669-5404780906-72157626069975129", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5404780906/#comment72157632501317904", "realname": "", "path_alias": "malawirail", "author": "79159520@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1357966404", "_content": "Closer scrutiny of the photo shows that both the screw steamers are, taking into account the quality of the image, identical.  Each vessel has an outward curved bow - a feature which only the gunboats PIONEER and ADVENTURE had - the other lake steamers had straight bows. There is a fine photo of the ADVENTURE in 'Lake Malawi Steamers' by P.A. Cole-King. Built by Yarrow &amp; Co.  in 1891, the steamers were assembled and launched on Lake Malawi in 1893.", "authorname": "degahk", "id": "31569669-5404780906-72157632501317904", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404780906"}}
