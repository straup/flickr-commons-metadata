In the centre is the Governor, Sir Richard Turnbull, inclining towards the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt Hon. Iain Macleod, MP.  On Mr Macleod's left is Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, President of TANU. To the right of Mr Nyerere is Mr Nsilo Swai. Behind Mr Swai's head is Mr Amir Jamal, and on extreme right is Mr George Kahama. On extreme left of the picture is (I think) Chief A S Fundikira.  Next to him is Mr M J Davies, then Sir Ernest Vasey. In the row behind from left are Mr Nick Kassum, and next but one is Mr Derek Bryceson,bending towards who I guess to be Mr Rashidi Kawawa.", "authorname": "tazamapichadfbleb", "id": "31569669-5404835355-72157627477645753", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404835355"}}
