Laibon means spiritual leader.   They were thought to possess many powers including the ability to foretell the future - such as the coming of the white man and with him the iron snake - the railway.   The photo is of  the Laibon Sendeyo (spelling may vary as there were no written African languages at the time).   He was the elder son of the Laibon M'batian (after whom the tallest peak on Mt Kenya is named and who died in about 1890).   The well-known Laibon Lenana (shown in these series of photo and also after which the third highest peak on Mt Kenya is named) was the younger son.   There is an Esau and Jacob story around the two sons in terms of who received the father's dying blessings and therefore became Laibon.  There is insufficient space to go into the details rather than say it was Lenana who ended up with the blessings and Sendeyo who went into exile.  Apparently the Loita, Ndamat and Kitetu clans declined to follow Lenana but recognised Sendeyo instead.", "authorname": "PigaPicha1", "id": "31569669-5404381173-72157626070440536", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5404381173"}}
