The picture could have been taken on either day, but perhaps is more probably on the final day. The British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt.Hon.Iain Macleod, MP, is in the centre on the far side. On his right hand side (on left in the picture) is Mr W B L Monson, Assistant Under-Secretary of State in the Colonial Office in London. On Mr Monson's right is Mr B E Rolfe, of the Colonial Office. The Governor of Tanganyika, Sir Richard Turnbull, KCMG, is in the centre on the left side. On the Governor's right is Mr John Fletcher-Cooke, CMG, the Deputy Governor.  Next to him is Mr M J Davies, the Minister for Information Services. On the Governor's left is the Attorney-General, Mr J S R Cole, QC.  On the near side, with backs to the camera, are the elected ministers, with the Chief Minister, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, in the centre.  On Mr Nyerere's right is probably Mr Roland Brown, the legal adviser. Next but one from him, at the end of that row,  is Mr D N M Bryceson, Minister for Health and Labour. On the the right hand side are other elected Ministers and TANU representatives.", "authorname": "tazamapichadfbleb", "id": "31569669-5405436302-72157627833745508", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5405436302"}}
