The Diamond plantation was well known, and the rum made there, Diamond Rum, was very famous. These houses are new compared to the old houses where enslaved workers used to reside before freedom from African enslavement, but they were probably close to the old \u2018African enslaved\u2019 quarters.  Molasses made from Demerara rum is a famous product of Guyana.", "authorname": "The National Archives UK", "id": "31569669-8023322405-72157638179268565", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8023322405"}}
