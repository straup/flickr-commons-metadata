Mauby is a bitter sweet drink with medical properties and you can buy the bark on the web. Another woman in the audience added that the bark can also be bought in London. Other audience members indicated that the Mauby drink is well known in other parts of the Caribbean, including Guyana and Jamaica. In Guyana it is especially popular at Christmas time.
