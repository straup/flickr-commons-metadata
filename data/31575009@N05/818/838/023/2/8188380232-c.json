Later, due to increasing student numbers two sites were occupied, one in Grote street and one in Currie Street.  After WW2 it was decided to build a new school on the corner of West Terrace and Glover Avenue.  This became Adelaide Boys High School while the Grote Street buildings became Adelaide Girls High School.  In 2007 the buildings became a performing arts centre.", "authorname": "M_Ozzie", "id": "31569669-8188380232-72157632696635141", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8188380232"}}
