Adelaide was not settled until 1836, so the photos dated before then, while obviously early scenes, were not as early as 1826!  I would guess more likely to be early 1840s.  Someone else may know precisely.\nJan", "authorname": "jannan50", "id": "31569669-8188376972-72157632613374772", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8188376972"}}
