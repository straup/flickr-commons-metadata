The turret on the right is the Perth Town Hall, on the corner of Hay Street and Barrack Street. (though I believe in this photo collection Hay Street is referred to as Flag Street).\nIf you look at the large resolution of this photo you will see that behind and to the right of the Town Hall turret is a tall white building, this is St Mary's Cathedral.\n\nThe first stage of St Mary's Cathedral was completed in 1865, and both Wesley Church and Perth Town Hall were completed in 1870, so I would estimate this photo is taken between 1870-1880.", "authorname": "odonja09", "id": "31569669-8188600554-72157632609356861", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8188600554"}}
