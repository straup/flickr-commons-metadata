The photographs themselves were intended for display at the London Exhibition of 1873; Pickering was previously engaged as the official photographer to the Metropolitan Intercolonial Exhibition of 1870. Photographers such as Charles Nettleton and the firm of Cox &amp; Luckin were given similiar commissions in Melbourne as photography played an increasingly important role in the work of government departments.\n \n(The collection is on the State Libray of N.S.W. database. This database has a facility to view photographs in a high quality resolution which is really the best way to view the photographs - because of size constraints I will post a link to the high resolution version beneath each photograph).", "authorname": "juneb2012", "id": "31569669-8188170298-72157632629928265", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8188170298"}}
