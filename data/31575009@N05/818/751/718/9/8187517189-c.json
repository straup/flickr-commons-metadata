Follow that mast to its tip, and look just to the left of it, there you will see the white shape of the mill. \nThis Mill is one of Perth's oldest remaining buildings, built in 1835 just 6 years after the arrival of the first settlers.\n\nIt has been restored and well perserved by the city of South Perth, and is now clearly visible from the Mitchell Freeway which was actually diverted slightly to preserve the Mill.\nFor more information you can always start with the wikipedia article: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Mill,_Perth\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Mill,_Perth</a>", "authorname": "odonja09", "id": "31569669-8187517189-72157632614214150", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/8187517189/#comment72157632610399225", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92558352@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1359189233", "_content": "Kwinana freeway, not mitchell. :)", "authorname": "looktall", "id": "31569669-8187517189-72157632610399225", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8187517189"}}
