Mr. Platts opened a music business in Gilles arcade in about October of the same year, and in March, 1841, moved to premises in Hindley street, opposite Rosina street.  Later he took the shop on the corner of King William street.   On 11th November, 1871, old and bankrupt, he died, and his executors sold the business to E. S. Wigg, bookseller and stationer.   Within a month of purchase, Wigg sold the corner shop to Rundle street bookseller John Howell.   When Howell described the business in advertisements as &quot;Howell, late Platts' corner, Wigg objected, and Howell chose to call it &quot;Howell's Corner.&quot;   John Howell died in August, 1878, and the business closed down.   Platts is remembered today by booksellers and historians because he published the Almanacs and one or two books now of antiquarian interest.    John Howell's name is largely forgotten.   The firm of E.S.Wigg &amp; Son, now at Thebarton, continues, the only bookseller to survive from the colonial era.
