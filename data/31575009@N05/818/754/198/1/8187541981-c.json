I think I read somewhere the original bridge was destroyed in floods in about the 1860's  This view is perhaps from McCallum Park  foreshore (farm land owned by the Manning family?) on the corner of what would now be Canning Highway (old Fremantle Road) &amp; Albany Highway in Victoria Park. The current Causeway Bridge was built around 1954(?) Originally the Swan River at this point tended to be quite impassable at times due to swamp and reeds and so flat bottomed vessels carried passengers and livestock across river for a small price .", "authorname": "bradjc8@bigpond.com", "id": "31569669-8187541981-72157632611364441", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8187541981"}}
