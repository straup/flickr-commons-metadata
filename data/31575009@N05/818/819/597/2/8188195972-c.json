The 'second' Sydney station - or third terminal is the current station in Railway Square. \n\nIt is interesting that as early as 1848 (seven years before the opening of the line to Granville/Parramatta) the Sydney Railway Company was agitating for the government to approve extending the line to what we now know as Belmore Park (Hay Street). The objective being to build the original terminal there and thus a couple of miles closer to the city. It is a matter of history that Central Railway (the 'third' terminal) was opened in 1906, some 58 years after the proposal and in virtually the same spot as the 1848 proposal!\n\nCynics would say that this set the precedent for future decision making - the completion of the City Circle in 1956, the Eastern Suburbs Railway in 1977 and so on! Let's hope the second railway crossing of Sydney Harbour bringing the North West Rail Link into the city and beyond isn't delayed much beyond 2020!", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "31569669-8188195972-72157634712413091", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/8188195972/#comment72157634719016680", "realname": "John Cowper", "path_alias": "johncowper", "author": "21647809@N04", "iconserver": "7404", "datecreate": "1374321684", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/81028427@N04] A great article - what a pity it wasn't accompanied by a photographer!", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "31569669-8188195972-72157634719016680", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/8188195972/#comment72157634719021384", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1374321720", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/81028427@N04] It may/must be an earlier photo (from a series of the Mortuary Station) recycled.
