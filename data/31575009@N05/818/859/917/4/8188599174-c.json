If this was written with two strokes, it well may appear to a non-West Australian as an 'Fl'.   Similarly, with a Victorian flourish, the last letter - y - could easily seem to be a 'g'.

The Town Hall was the central office for telegraph communications and a flag would be raised from the tower when overseas or interstate mail had arrived.\n\n\n from hptrails.com.au   Perth Town Hall History\nWhen the Perth Town Hall opened in 1870 it was described as \u201ca place that symbolised the harmony of interests in the colony.\u201d It was to be a meeting place of the citizens of Perth, a forum for Government of the city and discussion of matters important.\n\nBy 1924 the Council had outgrown the available space in the Town Hall. A proposal to demolish the hall and construct a five storey office building was met with spirited public protests and defeated. Instead, the Council moved to the Strelitz building on Murray Street. The Council offices and chambers were moved there the same year", "authorname": "One Red Kelpie", "id": "31569669-8188599174-72157632611048915", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/8188599174/#comment72157632632397076", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nationalarchives", "author": "31575009@N05", "iconserver": "7325", "datecreate": "1359371806", "_content": "I have updated the description for this image and the others on Hay Street.
