This censor label also has a reference number &quot;PC66&quot; at the top right, barely seen in the image, and at that time the text on the labels reads &quot;OPENED BY CENSOR&quot; but this was changed to &quot;OPENED BY EXAMINER&quot;. The very latest use I have seen of this type of label is July 1940, so this photo must have been taken before then. Most of this info can be verified in the Torrance &amp; Morenweiser UK censorship book published by the Civil Censorship Study Group, British Empire Civil Censorship Devices WWII: Section 2 (pub 1991): Civil Censorship in United Kingdom.", "authorname": "ww2censor", "id": "31569669-4327205239-72157630876860922", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4327205239"}}
