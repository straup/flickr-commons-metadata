This portrays him at Kalenga on 9 June 1954, the day when the Governor of Tanganyika, Sir Edward Twining, KCMG, ceremonially returned to him and to the Hehe people as a whole the skull of  Adam Sapi's renowned grandfather Mkwawa who had defeated a German military force at Lugalo in 1891, but who in 1898 committed suicide in order to avoid capture by the then superior German forces.  The skull had been taken back to Germany, and under the Versailles Treaty of 1919 when Germany was deprived of its colonies it was supposed to be returned to Tanganyika. But that did not happen and Twining personally traced the skull to the Bremen Anthropological Museum in 1949 and eventually was able to deliver it back to the Hehe.", "authorname": "tazamapichadfbleb", "id": "31569669-5424880423-72157627985203826", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5424880423"}}
