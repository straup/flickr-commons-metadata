JOHN'S RIVER. OLD JETTY AND WAREHOUSES - The territory in the neighbourhood of Port St. John's was secured by the Imperial Government from Umgolizo, a native chief, in 1878.  Owing to the European Powers annexing various parts of the Continent of South Africa, Pondoland was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the country was afterwards ceded to Cape Colony in 1894.  The Port itself is situated at the mouth of the Umzimvubu River, which inside the &quot;Bar,&quot; is a magnificent estuary, extending several miles into the country.  At present the trade done is small, but its prospects are improving.  Three steamers of light draught convey cargo between the port and Durban and East London.", "authorname": "Erica Fotokosa", "id": "31569669-5425172959-72157625921628471", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5425172959"}}
