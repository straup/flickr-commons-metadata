Various points of reference in the photo are Bissex Hill, what is now Barclays Park, Belleplaine and Chalky Mount. The vantage point is probably somewhere around 13 12 06 N, 59 33 40 W.\n\nThe tall structure in the lower left quadrant is likely to be a windmill, to provide the power for crushing sugar cane. Might even be the one on what was Richmond Plantation, though it's hard to be sure.", "authorname": "cricalix", "id": "31569669-7603468602-72157631390870788", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "7603468602"}}
