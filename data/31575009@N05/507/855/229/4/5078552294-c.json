However, I believe that is incorrect.  The unique aircraft in the photo appears to  be a Miles M.57 Aerovan (&quot;Miles Aerovan&quot;).  The first Aerovan did not fly until 1945.  Given the fact that a Pickford's transporter is featured in the photo, I suspect this is a Miles M.57 Aerovan IV (c/n 6400), registered as G-AILF.  G-AILF was leased by Pickford's Airways from October 1948 to August 20, 1950, when it was damaged beyond repair (DBR) (without any fatalities to its two crew) in Guernsey. \n\nApproximately 52 Miles Aerovans would be built, and the design would serve to be the progenitor of the far more successful Short Brothers SC.7 Skyvan and its Short 330 (SD3-30) and Short 360 (SD3-60) derivatives, many of which fly in service with a variety of civilian and military operators (including the US Air Force) to this day.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "31569669-5078552294-72157625160454295", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5078552294/#comment72157625642118562", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1292893239", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Aerovan\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Aerovan</a>", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "id": "31569669-5078552294-72157625642118562", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5078552294/#comment72157625746921294", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nationalarchives", "author": "31575009@N05", "iconserver": "7325", "datecreate": "1294162028", "_content": "Having checked the file we have absolutely no dates for this at all.
