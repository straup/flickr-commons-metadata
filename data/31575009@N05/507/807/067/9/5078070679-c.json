Prier told the press that he set off following the River Thames before heading south to Chatham, Canterbury and Dover. I suspect that this photo shows M Prier offering a toast to the success of his flight, before he left Hendon. At the front of his cockpit is a map showing the first part of his route along the Thames. This would date the photo to the morning of 12 April 1911.", "authorname": "Picture Esk", "id": "31569669-5078070679-72157625306836435", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5078070679"}}
