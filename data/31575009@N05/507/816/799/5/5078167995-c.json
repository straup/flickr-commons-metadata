The small steamer &quot;Escurial&quot;, carrying a load of Welsh coal, had left Cardiff on the morning of Thursday 24 January 1895. \nBy early Friday morning she was sending up distress flares, and by the time dawn broke she was grounded off Portreath on the north coast of Cornwall. A message was sent to the nearest lifeboat at Hayle, and horses pulled the boat the 9 miles to Portreath. This lifeboat was the &quot;F.H.Harrison&quot; a self-righting, 32 foot long boat pulling 10 oars. She arrived at noon, but difficulties were found in launching the boat into the surf, and when eventually she was launched, she turned broadside to the waves and was overturned washed onto the beach. \nCoastguards tried to rescue the crew by firing rocket-lines to the ship, but most fell short.\nOf the 20 strong crew 11 were drowned. Most of the crew who were saved, owed their lives to lifeboatmen and locals who linked arms and waded into the surf to rescue them as they were washed ashore.", "authorname": "Picture Esk", "id": "31569669-5078167995-72157625431324766", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/5078167995/#comment72157625495036864", "realname": "", "path_alias": "yolithestar", "author": "38275788@N06", "iconserver": "7355", "datecreate": "1291064108", "_content": "The tones add a sense of drama and urgency!\n\nYoli", "authorname": "Garden Flower", "id": "31569669-5078167995-72157625495036864", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5078167995"}}
