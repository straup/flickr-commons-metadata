A combination of nearby marl hole (clay quarry) and the underlying 30-foot seam of thick coal have led to subsidence contorting the building so great that pin-pong balls appear to roll uphill on the backs of the benches. Thus it has morphed from quarrymen's pub to a destination for dining and a walkers (and riders) drop in. It has a lovely warm fire on a winters day too!
