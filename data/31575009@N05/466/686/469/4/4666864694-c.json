But I doubt that if of these speeches would have made the headlines in the UK.\nThis is more likely to have been the headline on 13 February 1931. That day most newspapers reported on The Pope officially opening the Vatican's own radio station the day before, when the Pope's address was broadcast around the world for the first time. So his speech was not &quot;astonishing&quot; for its content, but by how it had been delivered. Journalistic hype even in the 1930s.", "authorname": "Picture Esk", "id": "31569669-4666864694-72157625206115128", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4666864694"}}
