I have laboriously typed it out for posterity (thanks and copyright dues to Tony Butler - For keeping its history alive)\n\nPRIOR PARK HOUSE\nTHERE are ghosts about this stately historic house. But then, a house wouldn't be stately or historic unless it had its whispering  ghosts. Just the other day, I walked through Prior Park House and was immediately taken by the character of the place. An aura of Victorian eccentricity seemed to emanate from every room. It is a noble building, soon, I believe to be demolished, to make way for new, modern homes. It's a shame such a fine building has to go. But such is progress, they tell me!\n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century, Prior Park House was opened by the Quakers as a boarding school for girls. Walking through the old house, I was transported back in time and could almost sense the ghosts of young school-girlish laughter as their spirits flitted from room to room. Below stairs, where the kitchens and servants' quarters  were, is eerliy quiet. Here, in an era long past, the cook reigned supreme, when parlour-maids and footmen looked after their master's and mistress' each and every whim. There is an air of &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; about Prior Park House when, no doubt, it once boasted its very own 'Mrs Bridges', 'Hudson', 'Rose' and 'Polly'.  \n\nWhereas you might find the occasional ghost about the house, you have no chances of finding any around the grounds, simply because there's no place to hide. The beautiful historic trees which dotted these fine grounds are no longer there. It's like a tornado has ripped through the grounds. The beautiful Giant Sequoia and Chilean Pine are no more - a few hours with a chainsaw to dispatch an era of historic growth. The many changes around Clonmel these fine trees must have witnessed are now sadly dispatched to the lumber yard. If you have a spare tear, then shed it for Prior Park House.\n\nFROM LITTLE ACORNS\nPrior Park is a very historic area of Clonmel, situated to the north outside what was once the old town walls. Growing up, I often heard people refer to this area as 'Gallows Hill', a place of execution in olden days. The name Prior Park goes back many centuries to the infancy of the town. The White family, who owned much of the property and land around Clonmel during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century had possession of the Prior Park area. It is recorded that, in September 1589, the Whites owned four Gardens north of Lough Gate (the old North Gate which was situated at the top of Gladstone Street). About this time, the Prior of Athassel Abbey was also Rector or Parish Priest of Clonmel. This Augustinian Canon who actually discharged the duties of the parish was Vicar of Clonmel, hence the name Prior Park or Prior Lands. This arrangement continued down to the Reformation.\n\nDr Burke, in his History of Clonmel, tells us that a Quaker school existed in the town in 1796 when, on December 20th, Robert Grubb, by will, bequethed the premises to twelve trustees to hold out for the purpose of a school. He also left them an annual rent of \u00a360 derived out of the flour mills held by Thomas Grubb, such a rent to be paid to the governors of the school for the time being, whom they should appoint. \n\nIn 1846, the trustees, on petition to the Lord Chancellor, obtained power to lease the school premises to Joshua Malcolmson for three hundred years at a rent of \u00a340. I have a map of Clonmel dated 1832, on which the area north of Oaklands is open farmland. Melview, owned by David Malcolmson, is indicated as Backbone Lane where ther present Shamrock Hill stands. The railway station didn't come about until December 1876 when the first train ran from Clonmel to Fethard.\n\nOn August 30th 1847, a lease of 2 acres, 2 roods and 23 perches of Prior Park was obtained from Henry Pedder, in consideration of \u00a3166.13s4d, the rent being \u00a315 a year. The friends' Boarding School for Girls came into being. The new schools, including Prior Park, cost \u00a32,584.14s8d and were erected from funds raised by mortgage of the old school premises and the endowment. It accommodated thirty-two boarders. In 1858, fifteen were in residence and paid a pension of \u00a337 - \u00a342. The school was most creditably conducted, the premises scrupulously clean and the teachers well qualified. The pupils were well instructed in French, drawing, English literature, geometry, natural philosophy and elements of astronomy. Music of any kind was not taught, that accomplishment not being approved of by the Society of Friends.\n\nSo you can all see how historically important Prior Park House is. I hope it won't be demolished - but I suppose it  will. People have chained themselves to railings in protest at a lot less!   \n\n\nNow NLI - I bet you wish you hadn't asked 'Why was it demolished' !!!!!!!!", "authorname": "Desktop 123", "id": "47267889-7800418730-72157631660087333", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7800418730/#comment72157631665336055", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1349085571", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/77528096@N06] Not at all!

Not sure of the date, but paper likely to be 'The Nationalist' or 'South Tipp Today':\n'Prior Park' house was sold on 29.6.1864 to Benjamin Murphy. It was a private residence occupied by the Murphy family, owners of Murphy's  Clonmel Brewery. In 1918 the widowed MRS Murphy, who was living there, was one of the many  passengers drowned when the R.M.S.Leinster, on its regular trip from Dun Laoghaire to Holyhead, was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. \n****************************************************************************************************\nI Just want to add a brief history of Prior Park House. It was only owned by 2 families (Murphy and O'Gorman) after it was a School and I believe it's history is:\n1) On August 30th 1847 Henry Pedder sold over 2 acres of land and Prior Park House was built. \n2) 1847 - 1864  Girls Boarding School, run by the Quakers.\n3) 29.6.1864 Bought by Benjamin Murphy - Passed on to Thomas Murphy or John M.
