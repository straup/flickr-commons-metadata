If you zoom and look closely you will see the sail rolled up on the gaffe.\n\nThe sailing rig for an Achill Yawl is called a dipping lug. The reason the mast is un stepped is that the boats hauled turf from Saula north of michael davitt bridge to Sraheens, Derreens and Cloughmore, south of the bridge. The mast was taken down and raised to get the yawls under the bridge.\n\nYou will notice the boat in the foreground is in a strong current. It shows that the boats are just after comming under the bridge taking advantage of the strong flowing tide. This tide would have taken then thus far at an average rate of 4 knots so the oarsmen and woman would have been keeping the yawl on course rather than providingthe main propulsion. Voyages would be planned to coincide with tide times.\n\nIf you look closely at the boat in the foreground you can see the &quot;Cliabh&quot; or baskets that were used to carry tthe turf off the bog to the boat. These were carried on the back with either one or two slings. You need to consider that the real work involved was the multiple handling of the turf before it was stacked neatly beside the house; By Cliabh to the boat and then carefully built in the boat (Of critical importance here was to ensure that the correct space was left for the mast to be raised and lowered. then the turf had to be unloaded and carried to the house from the shore at the destination.", "authorname": "Scad\u00e1n Dearg", "id": "47267889-6961206321-72157630112519860", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6961206321/#comment72157630051761399", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1339530859", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/80413507@N08] Hello there!
