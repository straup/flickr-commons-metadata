The shops on the left were still in full swing, the building with the arched windows on the left was the old Limerick Corporation building and meeting room.  My mother was born in the second street on the left, Ellen Street and in the haze on the right is Cannocks clock, a Limerick landmark.  My earliest memory of Patrick Street was standing on the pavement waiting for the &quot;An Tostal&quot; parade to take place there and seeing a Garda Inspector or Superintendent in their lighter blue uniform walking about with a walking stick.  Those sticks were in use until the early 1970's after the Conroy Commission brought in lots of changes to the service.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-5743898655-72157627431083631", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5743898655/#comment72157627556237300", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1314731536", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/swordscookie] Wow, what a memory!
