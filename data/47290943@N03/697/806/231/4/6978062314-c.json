She was always known as Blanche. \n\nOn 7 August 1902, a stormy day with heavy seas, Blanch and a number of friends decided to go swimming. The beach at Bonmahon is treacherous in any bad weather as a rip tide cuts deep channels in the sand and in stormy weather must be avoided. Despite being advised otherwise the party went swimming. Many got into difficulty and both coastguard and local men then tried to save them. \n\nA local man, Cornelius (Con) Sarsfield, saved Blanche. A coastguard, one Frederick Shaw, saved some others and then he was drowned, but the girl he was trying to save got back to shore with help from other helpers. Another girl died. Shaw was buried in a grave in Bonmahon churchyard just beside the final resting place of Blanch herself. \n\nBlanch married her first cousin and sister-in-law's brother, <b>Thomas Francis Buckley</b>, on 29 April 1907. (There is a photograph in the Poole collection at the National Library of Ireland.) \n\nTom had been born at Hackney in the last quarter of 1882. In 1901 he was working as a jeweller's assistant in the family business, Buckley &amp; Lovell in Ludgate Hill, London. At the time of his marriage, he had a printer's and stationer's shop at 112 Wealdstone High Street. He was also sub-postmaster. \n\nThe couple settled in Wealdstone, and were there in 1911, but when Blanch's brother, Dick, died in 1919, they returned to Bonmahon to help Maisie with the business.\n\n<a href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~davie/misc/Watts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~davie/misc/Wat...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001224382/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001224382/</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-6978062314-72157629560082348", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6978062314/#comment72157629560203978", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1335702699", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Brilliant, thank you!
