The pointsmans boxes were introduced to speed up traffic by making the Garda more visible, one of a number of experiments including the one where the Garda wore the &quot;ice-cream sellers&quot; jacket you put up earlier.  The problem with the boxes is that drivers did not always see the Garda and being able to walk about and give clear signals in the drivers line of sight was taken away from them.  They were taken out again shortly after they were installed.  Bachelors Walk looked so much more colourful and interesting in those days, didn't it?", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-6092353714-72157627419836925", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6092353714/#comment72157627545997834", "realname": "Tadgh \u00d3 Maoildearg", "path_alias": "timstimes", "author": "7225349@N03", "iconserver": "7356", "datecreate": "1314628033", "_content": "love the colours on the buildings on the Walk!", "authorname": "Tadgh \u00f3 Maoildearg", "id": "47267889-6092353714-72157627545997834", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6092353714/#comment72157627547544716", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "13877445@N06", "iconserver": "7281", "datecreate": "1314640737", "_content": "The stripes, obviously meant to make the box stand out, seem to make it, in this photo at least, blend in with the surroundings.
