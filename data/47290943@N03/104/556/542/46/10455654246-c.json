JR (Jack) White was a colourful character with a fine biography in Wikipaedia.  Here is a short extract relevant to this meeting. White resigned his commission in 1907, citing disaffection with the army and its role. During the next few years White travelled to Bohemia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire), lived in a Tolstoyan commune in England and then travelled and worked in Canada.\nArriving back in Ireland, he found Sir Edward Carson's campaign against Home Rule was beginning. This was the time when the Ulster Volunteers were created to threaten war against the British government if Ireland were granted any measure of self-rule.\nJack organised one of the first Protestant pro-Home Rule meetings, in Ballymoney, to rally Protestant opinion against the Unionist Party and against what he described as its &quot;bigotry and stagnation&quot;, that associated Ulster Protestants with conservatism. Another speaker at that meeting, coming from a similar social background, was Sir Roger Casement.\nAs a result of the Ballymoney meeting White was invited to Dublin. Here he met James Connolly and was converted to socialism. Very impressed by the great struggle to win trade union recognition and resist the attacks of William Martin Murphy and his confederates, he offered his services to the ITGWU at Liberty Hall. He spoke on union platforms with people such as Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Bill Haywood of the Industrial Workers of the World, and Connolly.   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White_\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White_</a>(trade_unionist)", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-10455654246-72157636914065006", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10455654246/#comment72157636922709586", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1382672736", "_content": "Or this, more than you wanted to know on the subject.
