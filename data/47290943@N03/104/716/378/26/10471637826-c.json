J. M'Devitt, as reported in Freeman's on Nov 29 1876\n<blockquote>The Rev. Lecturer said a thick rain was falling when he drove late one evening last summer over the long and steep hill of Mcenaroy, near Letterkenny, in the county Donegal. Looking before him into the dim twilight he saw a figure moving forward with much difficulty. Soon he came up with a peasant carrying a parcel on his back, who told him he was returning from a pilgrimage to &quot;<b>Doon Well</b>,&quot; with a few bottles of its miraculous water, and that his home was still distant thirty miles off, near those mighty cliffs on the western coast of the county beneath which the waves of the wild Atlantic rave and roar for ever. The peasant went on to talk with enthusiasm of the supernatural powers of his precious burden, while he listened, and fancied he heard in the wind the sneers of modern unbelievers, directed, however with harmless effect, against the strong faith of the humble pilgrim (applause).</blockquote>\n\nBut no  mention of a scary-eyed woman, unfortunately.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-10471637826-72157637119989006", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10471637826/#comment72157637121368135", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1383142278", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Nice account.", "authorname": "OwenMacC", "id": "47267889-10471637826-72157637121368135", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "10471637826"}}
