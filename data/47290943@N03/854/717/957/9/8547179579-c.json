I know that were he still with us he would have been delighted to pass on this info.\n\nFinn Sullivan was bom in Harbour View House (located just to the right of where this photograph was taken).  His grandfather, Daniel Dunne, was a fisherman and the Harbour Master in Adrigole overseeing the unloading of supplies from the SS Lady Elsie, an eighty-seven foot-long steel plated ship with a compound steam engine that had been built in Greenock in 1906 and was captained by Redmond Clarke.  In later years Daniel's only son Eugene took over the position of Harbour Master and was in charge of transport and business on the pier, namely managing the cargo from the SS Princess Beara, a one hundred and fifteen foot long, steel plated vessel that had been built in Greenock in 1901, captained by Dan McCarthy and delivered essential provisions for the shops including farm equipment and cement.  Finn recalls that, \u201cAll the provisions were stored in the big shed on the pier and there was a flagstaff above it and if things were quiet and no provisions were required the flag was hoisted so that the Princess Beara need not call to the pier\u201d.\n\nThe Bantry Bay Steamship Company had been providing a goods service from Bantry to Glengarriff and Castletownbere but passengers were also carried.  In 1906 the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway provided a sum of two thousand pounds for the purchase of the new steamer, the Lady Elsie, which went into service in 1906 replacing the Lady Balfour.  Initially, the Lady Elsie ran between Bantry and Glengarriff the journey taking forty-five minutes and cost the passenger one shilling and five pence, \u201cThe Lady Elsie was the first ship people in the area remember; its route was Bantry, Glengarriff, Adrigole, Bere Island, and Castletownbere.  The ship took emigrants away from Adrigole and when passengers reached Bantry they took the train to Cork.\u201d  The first train from Cork to Bantry ran on the 4th July 1881.\n\n\u201cMy own father took that boat with his sister Mary; my father was the eldest boy in the family and he went to America with the eldest girl in the family, Mary Sullivan from Rock House, Adrigole.  They arrived on Ellis Island in 1923 and Mary never returned to Ireland; she settled in Boston where she married Michael Sullivan from Faha East, Adrigole, and had three children.  Mary was widowed when Michael was killed on the docks in an accident.\u201d\n\nThe Princess Beara provided a goods service only and sailed weekly from Castletownbere at eight thirty in the morning and returning to Bantry Pier at 1.00pm where it connected with trains from Cork.  Eventually the Princess Beara was withdrawn from service in 1948 and sold for six thousand pounds making the crew of seven redundant.  A road by lorry from Bantry to Castletownbere had resulted in a decline in traffic by sea.\n\nEugene Dunne moved to Bere Island where he was Harbour Master while the navy fleet was based there and his sister Margaret took over the running of supplies at the pier.  The navy eventually left Bere Island in 1932.  It was at this time that labourers working on the Healy Pass earned one shilling and sixpence a day to build the winding road.  Eugene owned a salmon seine and Finn recalls that the \u201cKeohanes of Bantry used to fish for Eugene in Adrigole, and the Downey brothers of Whiddy Island, in later years\u201d.  Eugene had one of the first radios in Adrigole in 1940 powered by batteries; the ESB came to Beara in 1952, the signal was brought from Mullaghanish Mountain in Ballyvourney and Eugene installed one of the first televisions in 1963.\n\nEugene Dunne started a general store on the main Glengarriff/Castletownbere road that sold everything, including suits, timber, boots, shoes and groceries. In the early days he was assisted by his niece Maura Dunne until her marriage to Jack O'Sullivan Thady of Droumlave.  Finn's sister Maureen then helped to run the store until her marriage to Paddy McEvoy, from Hazel Hatch, County Kildare.  The post office came to the store on the 4th February 1959 under the management of Eugene Dunne.  Eugene\u2019s nephew, Finn Sullivan, took on the management of the post office in 1960.  \u201cWhen I took over the Post Office,\u201d Finn remembers, \u201cthere were also three or four Gardai and a Sergeant in the parish.  In the post office there was a telephone switchboard and two Postmen who used bikes; later it was reduced to one man who used a motorcycle and in later years a motor van.\u201d\n\nFinn's son Declan and his wife Orla took over the post office in 1999 and ran the business until they made the decision to close the shop and post office on the 24th September 2004.  The Postal Agency was transferred (back) to Peg\u2019s Shop.  In recent times many rural post offices on the Beara Peninsula have been closed down. The 1940s saw a huge exodus of people from Adrigole but now new businesses such as the West Cork Sailing and Powerboating Centre at the Pier House (located on the site of the old pier shed) are very progressive and a real asset to the area.\u201d", "authorname": "BearaBoy", "id": "47267889-8547179579-72157633042113743", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8547179579/#comment72157633042187165", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92418093@N08", "iconserver": "8257", "datecreate": "1363800499", "_content": "Would you like to see a photo of Eugene Dunne?\nI've uploaded one in my photostream (only 'cos I can't figure out how to insert a link here...)", "authorname": "BearaBoy", "id": "47267889-8547179579-72157633042187165", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8547179579/#comment72157633042364283", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1363802079", "_content": "Like this: \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/92418093@N08/8574508271/\" title=\"Eugene Dunne by BearaBoy, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8372/8574508271_6efb34221c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Eugene Dunne\" /></a>", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8547179579-72157633042364283", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8547179579/#comment72157633042372251", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1363802151", "_content": "Go to your photo, click share and choose the &quot;Grab the HTML/BBCode&quot; option.
