For nearly an hour the maddened animal could not be dislodged from the platform, and the utmost confusion prevailed. Ultimately a side gate was opened, and and the cow rushed wildly out, overturning two vehicles in her career, and making a desperate drive with her horns at a carter, who had a very narrow escape.

For example, a meeting of the Irish National Federation in the Town Hall in June 1892 in favour of the city\u2019s sitting anti-Parnellite MP, Francis O\u2019Keeffe, was broken up by the Parnellites wielding sticks. It had been previously alleged that O\u2019Keeffe had pledged his allegiance to Parnell \u2018to the death\u2019, but for some unapparent reason he \u2018found it necessary to change his opinion\u2019. As was the case in other cities, specific areas in the city, and particular leisure associations were known to be in favour of one side or the other. Cronin has argued that that in Cork this very bitter enmity had \u2018filtered down to working-class level not only through press and clerical pronouncements but also through \u2026highly politicised musical bands\u2019. \n\nLimerick was no different. A strong inter-locality political rivalry was enforced by the location and traditional rivalry of the city\u2019s various musical bands that often crossed into each other\u2019s areas thereby causing disturbances which the Constabulary had to control. The Boherbuoy Brass Band and the Sarsfield Fife and Drum Band, located respectively at Boherbuoy and Mungret Street, were allied to the Parnellite cause, while St. Mary\u2019s Fife and Drum Band, situated in St. Mary Street and the Victuallers\u2019 Band, Cornwallis Street (later Gerald Griffin Street), located opposite the City Dispensary, took anti-Parnellite side. Two examples illustrate the intensity of this enmity. In 1892 St. Mary\u2019s Fife and Drum Band deliberately marched through the rival Boherbuoy district, accompanied by a crowd \u2013 a sure recipe for the conflict that ensued until the police calmed the situation and the band returned to its rooms with some of its instruments damaged and others lost to the attackers. As if to give expression to the Old Testament creed of \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019, the Sarsfield Fife and Drum Band paid a visit to the Boherbuoy Band room where it was decided to seek retribution for the encroachment into Parnellite territory by making a return visit to the area of St. Mary\u2019s Band. Despite the intervention of the police in diverting the Sarsfield Band away from the immediate area, skirmishing between both sides ensued, resulting in injuries and this band also losing some of its instruments and having others damaged.\n\nTwo years later in <b>1894</b>, when the <b>Nelson Street Parnellite Band</b> was passing through Cornwallis Street, it was attacked by some members of the <b>Victuallers\u2019 Band</b>, which in turn led to the bandroom of the Victuallers\u2019 being broken into and damage estimated to be about sixty pounds caused, with practically all the instruments broken or vandalized. It had been thought that both sides were on \u2018the most friendly terms\u2019 and that \u2018they had buried the hatchet\u2019 but obviously <b>old enmities died hard and the proverbial hatchet was buried in the heads of opponents</b>.\n\nIf a person or family happened to be living in the enclave of either side in the political divide, especially during election time when emotions ran high, then they were in for a very hard time. John McGrath in a recent study on late nineteenth century Limerick, has pointed out that communities on both sides of the political divide guarded their territory very aggressively. During the 1892 election, anti-Parnellite houses in the strongly Parnellite Queen Street [later Thomas Davis Street] and Boherbuoy district were attacked; the shutters and windows were torn and smashed, while in the St. Mary Street area, which was largely Anti-Parnellite, people who harboured Parnellite tendencies had their windows broken. Popular memory recalls that one such Parnellite family living directly opposite the Anti-Parnellite St. Mary\u2019s Fife and Drum Band room was compelled to leave the locality in fear of their lives. Although this is anecdotal information, it echoes that which was reported in the Munster News of 13 July 1895 when the house of a man by the name of Thomas Kiely, a Parnellite, was attacked and wrecked after the election of that year.\n\nSuch <b>popular animosities</b> sometimes went beyond popular level to affect the city\u2019s political elite directly. Prior to the election of 1892, residence of Francis O\u2019Keeffe, MP in the elite area of the Crescent, and those of Councillor David Begly, in the middle-rank retailing William Street and Councillor Patrick O\u2019Malley, in the slightly more plebian High Street had their windows broken by Parnellite supporters. The latter two greeted the anti-Parnellite William O\u2019Brien, MP, a short time previously when he had arrived al <b>Limerick Railway Station</b> in support of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s parliamentary candidature. On that occasion, O\u2019Brien and his entourage, which was led by the Victuallers\u2019 Band, were attacked by Parnellites after he had addressed a convention of Federationists in the city. This attack had occurred as he walked up the major thoroughfare of Patrick Street, bricks were thrown from the tops of some of the houses and, in retaliation, the windows of the Parnellites\u2019 election rooms were broken.", "authorname": "K\u00f6lnMike", "id": "47267889-8089570753-72157631778865518", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8089570753/#comment72157631781162392", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1350360861", "_content": "This is the fair in question: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_International_Exhibition_%281907%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_International_Exhibition_%281...</a>", "authorname": "oaktree_brian_1976", "id": "47267889-8089570753-72157631781162392", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8089570753/#comment72157631780913541", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1350361142", "_content": "Carol, where is your poster with the date?
