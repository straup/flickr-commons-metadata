In the schools were some stoves which the patients thoroughly enjoyed. Later on we had an Infectious Hospital at Genoa, also a very nice hostel for sisters coming from the United Kingdom or moving about the country.</i>\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-11432159036-72157638805566253", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11432159036/#comment72157638804828395", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1387401880", "_content": "It seems from the chit-chat on this site ( <a href=\"http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=166514\" rel=\"nofollow\">1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=166514</a> ) that the hospital  was at the <b>Hotel Miramare</b> - <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_Miramare_di_Genova\" rel=\"nofollow\">it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_Miramare_di_Genova</a> - \n<blockquote>\n<i>With the outbreak of World War I, towards the end of 1916, the imposing building was converted into a hospital and housed over 500 wounded and subsequently transformed into barracks at the disposal of the troops of the 332 Infantry \u00ba American who held the headquarters until March 1919 .
