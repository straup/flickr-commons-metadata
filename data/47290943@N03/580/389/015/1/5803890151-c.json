In 1861 Wynne established a news agency and stationery shop in Castle St., Castlebar, moving (1864) to premises in Market St. (now Main St.), where the lines of merchandise were extended to include books, fine art prints, and sheet music. He also provided a newspaper delivery service, a lending library, and occasional day excursions by steamer from Westport, and set up as an auctioneer in 1886. ... \n\nIn 1867 Wynne established a photographic studio in the shop in Market St. The quality of the surviving photographs suggests that he may have been professionally trained. ... Wynne employed colourists and assistant photographers for periods, and was also assisted by at least three of his children whom he trained in photography, but it appears that he took most of the photographs himself, travelling frequently throughout the region.\n\nHe married (4 August 1860) Ellen Semple in the catholic church in Castlebar; she died in 1862 giving birth to their only child, John William. On 2 November 1863 he married Margaret Fox ... with whom he had five sons and five daughters. ... His youngest son, Richard James, continued the shop and photographic studio in Castlebar. Other sons provided photographic services at Limerick, Tipperary, and Portarlington, and his daughter Mary had a studio in Loughrea, Co.
