He was, arguably, one of the most important mariners in the 19th century. He helped make the world a global village by connecting empires and continents via submarine telegraph cables - in effect constructing the Victorian age communication network.\n\nThe name Tinakilly is derived from the townland of Tinakilly on which the house is built. It comes from the Gaelic; Ti=house: na=of the: Coille=wood. So the whole name in Irish means &quot;House of the Wood&quot;. It is probable that a farmhouse of the same name was on the site or close by. Some of the trees in the garden appear to predate the house which took ten years to build and was completed in 1883.\n \nTinakilly was constructed for Captain Robert Halpin.\n \nHalpin is reputed to have been given an open cheque by the British Government to build his new mansion in gratitude for his contribution to improving world communications and thereby world trade. He recruited the then very fashionable Irish architect, James Franklin Fuller, to design the house. The timber, which is so evident and gives such character, was selected in London by Halpin. The doors on the ground floor are of Burmese mahogany with many panels of different woods, the best of which are in &quot;birds eye&quot; maple. The architrave's, window shutters and stairs are in American pitch pine. Fireplaces were imported from Italy with the exception of the drawing room where a fine Georgian one, probably from an old house in Dublin, graces the room. The cellar, with space for 2,000 bottles of wine, is built of brick while the rest of the construction is in stone and mortar. The original working drawings can be seen hanging in the AnteRoom to the Brunei Dining Room.\n \nIn total, it cost \u00a340,000 to build Tinakilly (about \u00a34 million Sterling in today's value). The great hall cum living room with its fine gallery is the main feature. All ceilings are heavily corniced and are 14 foot high on the ground floor.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8204773855-72157632070960959", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204773855/#comment72157632075077267", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1353643281", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] That &quot;iconic&quot; image by Robert Howlett of Isambard Kingdom Brunel with chains at the launching of the 'Great Eastern' is worth a digression.  \n\nThe story behind the photo(s) - <a href=\"http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/how-to/icons-of-photography/534739/isambard-kingdom-brunel-by-robert-howlett-iconic-photograph\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/how-to/icons-of-photography...</a>\n\nShort video recreating the camera and glass negative to shoot Brunel things (fascinating) - <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7753000/7753202.stm\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7753000/7753202.stm</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-8204773855-72157632075077267", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204773855/#comment72157632087258647", "realname": "P\u00e1draig", "path_alias": "nintytwo", "author": "77181682@N02", "iconserver": "8179", "datecreate": "1353786458", "_content": "Hi,\nI wonder if the pic of the Great Eastern is not of  the ship in Dublin in 1886.\nCould Arklow have taken a ship of this draft?\nAnd take a look at this picture of the ship in Dublin. You cannot read the writing on her side but the quay and the sailing ship behind her bow looks a bit familiar.\nAnd the mooring buoy in the river.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nintytwo/8214880780/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/nintytwo/8214880780/in/photostream</a>\n\nThe story of the ship's visit to Dublin is interesting.\nThe port authorities did not welcome the proposal for her visit .\nThe Great eastern was then four times the size of any other ship in the world, 700 feet long and 120 ft beam. with a draft of 30 feet. The paddle wheels were 56 feet in diameter and her propellor was 24 feet in diameter.\nIt was proposed by the owners that she berth at the then new North Wall Extension where the public could visit her.  The port authorities would not agree to this for a number of reasons. There was the risk that she might go aground in the river and block the port indefinitely. She could be blown off the berth  which might cause a similar problem and significantly she would occupy the space of four normal ships in this prime location. They eventually agreed that she could come to dublin but insisted that she must berth at the then newly constructed  but not fully developed Alexandra Basin.\nThere the great ship would have to take the ground at low tide.\nHowever as she sailed into Dublin the master refused to risk his ship taking the ground  and the pilot having boarded the ship and taken her upriver  agreed with the captain that it would be unsafe to try to take her into the Alexandra Basin, (possibly because they had allowe the peak of tidal depth to pass) \nSo the great Eastern did in fact berth at the North Wall Extension, much to the chagrin of the Harbour Board. Since both the ships master and the pilot were acting in the interests of the safety of the ship there could be no legal challenge. To attempt to turn and reposition the ship was a risk nobody was prepared to take.\nThe next objection by the Board was to the crowds visiting the ship. However as there was no gated entrance they could not stop them. Others came to visit by way of the ships passenger tender , the Cambria which had accompanied the ship from Holyhead. The ship remained in Dublin until 3rd April 1887 when she left having been sold. She was eventually scrapped in Liverpool in 1889.", "authorname": "nintytwo", "id": "47267889-8204773855-72157632087258647", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204773855/#comment72157632091402850", "realname": "P\u00e1draig", "path_alias": "nintytwo", "author": "77181682@N02", "iconserver": "8179", "datecreate": "1353786951", "_content": "<a href=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8214990334_16ecf3ca69_m.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8214990334_16ecf3ca69_m.jpg</a>\n\nLook at this painting of the Great Eastern in all her glory.\nThis painting is in the National Maritime Museum in Dunlaoghaire", "authorname": "nintytwo", "id": "47267889-8204773855-72157632091402850", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204773855/#comment72157632092300249", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1353843776", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nintytwo] You make good points about Dublin as against Arklow. \nI think you might be right.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8204773855-72157632092300249", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204773855/#comment72157632092496095", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1353846074", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nintytwo] Hi yourself.
