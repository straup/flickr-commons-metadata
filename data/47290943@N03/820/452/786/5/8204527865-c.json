A worker got locked up inside the steel when it was being built and his tapping with a hammer could frequently be heard.  Blackpoolbeach has pointed out that she was converted to a cable ship to which I add that it was she who laid the first successful cable and we haven't lost touch with America ever since.  The first cable laid in 1859 broke beyond recovery but Great Western Union which had spent vast money in preparing to lay a cable into Alaska, across the Bering Strait, through Russia into Europe abandoned its plans immediately without a loss of dividend. Its directors knew a cable in this most inhospitable terrain on Earth could never compete with a cable across the Atlantic. The importance of 1859, however, is that a twenty five year licence to land a cable in Newfoundland began then - like a patent - to allow the investors recover their money.  That is why other companies couldn't come into Waterville and Ballinskelligs with transatlantic cables until 1884.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "47267889-8204527865-72157632067397176", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204527865/#comment72157632068194431", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1353561788", "_content": "Oh my, very nice.

And no bones were found when the ship was broken up.  \nThe first Atlantic cable was laid in1858 by the British ship HMS Agamemnon and the American USS Niagara, and failed after a few weeks because of electrical problems.  \nThe landing license in Newfoundland was for 50 years from 1854, when the Anglo-American Telegraph Company was established (and Marconi was thrown out of Newfoundland in 1901 because of this). But starting as early as 1869, to get around the Newfoundland restriction cables from France,Ireland, and the UK mainland were landed at Cape Cod Massachusetts, Rye Beach New Hampshire, and several points in Nova Scotia. By 1900 cables were also being landed at Coney Island New York. \nAnd it was Western Union which started work on the overland connection via Alaska in 1865, and abandoned the project after the 1866 cable was successfully laid.\n\nMuch more information on all of this <a href=\"http://atlantic-cable.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">on my website</a>.\n\nBill Burns", "authorname": "FTLD", "id": "47267889-8204527865-72157632937679586", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8204527865/#comment72157632940018414", "realname": "Mossy Carey", "path_alias": "mosskayree", "author": "69587809@N05", "iconserver": "7030", "datecreate": "1362656612", "_content": "Now, now, if one tells a ghost story he doesn't expect it should or shouldn't be believed or that the explanation surrounding it could be proved correct on examination.

In the early decades of the last century many guests in the Bay View Hotel, Waterville, listed themselves as telegraphers and this suggests that the Cable Station Houses were not available to them.  They were, most likely, single men; so the Lawrence photographer would have given the description quite accurately. Incidentally, the Huggard Family who owned the Bay View Hotel from about 1910 until long after the Cable Station closed remained very good friends not only with the telegraphers but with their families for generations afterwards.  The first of the Huggards to own the Bay View Hotel then bought the Butler Arms Hotel which had its beginning as a hotel in the year the Cable Station came to Waterville.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "47267889-8204527865-72157633142635824", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8204527865"}}
