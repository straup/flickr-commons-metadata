Shucks. Another Cork one that I missed. Serves me right for having a day-job. I don't have a lot to add at this point. The subject is unequivocal (Corn Market and original Parnell/Angelsea Bridge). And it seems like the date is now spot-on too (Corroborated at 1883). \n\nThe city-hall/bridge/road/quay and streetscape in the foreground has changed a lot (arson and bridge reconstruction).\n\nBut the warehouses in the background are recognisable and unchanged today: The bonded warehousing of the Customs House (now CHC) in left-middle-ground, and the warehousing of the Albert Road Railway Station* in right-middle-ground. (*which seems to be linked to <i>every</i> Cork photo posted somehow). It isn't clear to me whether these warehouses fall under the protected status of the terminal building. But, given their age I hope they remain unchanged for yet another 150 years.\n\nThe only bit of additional local &quot;did you know&quot; that I can offer at this point is the fact the ornate lampstands from the original swing bridge (as seen in &quot;our&quot; photo) weren't lost when the bridge was rebuilt.
