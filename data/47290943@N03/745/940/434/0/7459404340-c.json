Capel Street was taken into the one way system in 1964 and the traffic went from the bridge up to Bolton Street.  That was changed in the late 80's I think and now it goes down to the bridge from Parnell St.  Goodwins was a good shop with a distinguished clientele and it is great to see that it is still running though the dreadful quality of the neighbouring establishments can hardly help.  McQuillans are still going strong, Louis Copelands father had a small shop on the right close to McQuillans but they later took over the bank which is just past McQuillans in this shot.  At that time a young lad named Eddie Keher worked in that bank.  Capel Street still had several Jewish shops in 1960 but they were down closer to the bridge.  One of them had a dummy or model that they sat at a desk at night with a low light on and you would think that there was a man on guard throughout the night.
