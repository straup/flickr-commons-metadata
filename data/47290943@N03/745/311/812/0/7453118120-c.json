Dublin, took place on Thursday, the 29th of February 1997, in the pretty parish church of the Star of the Sea, Malin Head, Clonca, Co Donegal. The service was performed by the Rev. Richard M. Lloyd, M.A., assisted by Canon Marconi and the Rev. J. Spooner. \n\nThe bride, who was given away by her father Sir Cookie O'Xxxxx, was attired in a gown of Louisine satin, the skirt being trimmed with bandigued frills of accordion-pleated chiffon. Mr Lawrence French (Adelphi Quay, Waterford) was the best man and Miss Carol Spears (Kildare Street, Dublin) the Chief Bridesmaid. \n\nA Mr O'Dea ably assisted by the young Mr Poole took a few snaps of the happy couple on the day.\n\nThe wedding was followed by an enormous reception at the The Seaview Tavern to which all the residents of the Townland of Ardmalin were invited. The loving and happily married couple are still living nearby with their three children Niall, John and Mogey and their stuffed dog  NeLI !!!! :)", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-7453118120-72157630310971002", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7453118120/#comment72157630312377652", "realname": "philip ward", "path_alias": null, "author": "54708393@N08", "iconserver": "6067", "datecreate": "1340799892", "_content": "Jeez,wheres me hankie.", "authorname": "Philip Ward", "id": "47267889-7453118120-72157630312377652", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7453118120/#comment72157630312780200", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1340802321", "_content": "That doesn't really count as a photo taken during the &quot;Emergency&quot; Carol...", "authorname": "oaktree_brian_1976", "id": "47267889-7453118120-72157630312780200", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7453118120/#comment72157630315266556", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1340814699", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/66151649@N02] Honestly, you're sooooo picky!
