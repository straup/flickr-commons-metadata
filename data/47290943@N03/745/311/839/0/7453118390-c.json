The semaphore was also used to communicate with the keepers on Inishtrahull. That picture as far as Im aware was taken on the opening day of the Marconi Radio station on 1st January 1902. Just as an add on the roof of the building that the men are standing on was blown off during the Stephen day storm in 1998, its made of reinforced solid concrete!! it didnt collapse, it came straight off, the wind was gusting to 111mph.\n\nThe first Lloyds tower was built there in 1805, the current one in place was build in 1884, hence the start of weather reports from Malin Head. The Radio station was taken over by the post office in 1910 and was moved to a more central location about 1 mile away in 1922.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ronanmclaughlin/3598161521/\">www.flickr.com/photos/ronanmclaughlin/3598161521/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.malinheadcoastguardradio.com/history/history%20text.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.malinheadcoastguardradio.com/history/history%20text.htm</a>", "authorname": "Ronan.McLaughlin", "id": "47267889-7453118390-72157630499752814", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7453118390/#comment72157633166375375", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1365152080", "_content": "Any of you interested in Marconi (and within shouting distance of Howth) may like to know about this <a href=\"http://hurdygurdyradiomuseum.wordpress.com/marconi-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>day-long celebration</b></a> at the Hurdy Gurdy Radio Museum.
