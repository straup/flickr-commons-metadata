In eight years, he led Thurles to a phenomenal six county titles , three Munster titles and two All-Ireland titles. He was a leader in the real sense of the word and dragged the club up to his high standards using innovative tactics and training methods. The team favoured a ground hurling style and worked hard to perfect it. Jack Mockler (back row extreme right in the photo below) recounts how training under Semple involved the players lining up outside the Confraternity Hall, marching out to the Ragg, back in again to spend an hour or two skipping, some work on the punch-ball and then a practice match. It certainly puts Ger Loughnane's training of the Clare hurlers on the Hill of Crusheen in the ha'penny place! Semple also led the line well using his huge strength and strong ground stroke off either side to good effect. He was handy with the ball in hand too. He won the 1906 All-Ireland long-puck championship, hitting a 9oz ball (twice the weight of a modern day sliotar, see photo below) 96 yards. \n\nSemple's Blues, in large part back-boned by his own clubmates but with a sprinkling of Moycarkey and Jockey players, won the All-Ireland championships of 1906 (defeating Faughs of Dublin) and 1908 (defeating Kickhams of Dublin). \n\n1908 team from <a href=\"http://www.gaa.ie\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gaa.ie</a>\nTom Semple (capt.), T.
