He joined forces with his rival RJ Mecredy (The father of Irish Motoring) in June 1903 and they concentrated on Mecredy's publications, The Motor News and The Irish Cyclist. Percy was a founder member of the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland and of the Irish Aero Club. He was given the rank of Lieut. in the First World War RNVR and was in charge of naval recruiting.
