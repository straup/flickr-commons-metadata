The blue green trees are Sitka Spruce planted by the Irish Forestry Board - indeed they look fairly young - maybe from the 50s?  Indeed many visitors to the Valley tend to think of it as ancient woodland but the mining at the Upper Lake resulted in the complete deforestation of the site by the 19th century.  It's time Crann removed the conifers and replaced them with native sessile oak and some locally sourced Scot's pine.  Sitka needles attract negative ions from the atmosphere and with water run off this results in acid.  The acid leaks down onto the woodland floor and together with the fallen needles results in an acid soil causing leaching and acid water run off into the lakes.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "47267889-6917677730-72157629916910714", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6917677730/#comment72157633696095814", "realname": "P\u00e1draig", "path_alias": "nintytwo", "author": "77181682@N02", "iconserver": "8179", "datecreate": "1369522859", "_content": "Hi \ncoming back very late to make a comment on this picture.\nThe girl is Moira Doyle, or at least she was then.

I think the embassies frowned on those who joined their cultural groups only to go hillwalking and so the walkers started their own walking group The Ramblers, Now a very large national walking group celebrating 50 years very soon.\nWhen this bunch began to get married and have small children whom they wanted to bring out to the graet outdoors  the hardy hikers got a bit fed up with them, so an offshoot (the split as usual in Ireland ) group was formed called Na Coisithe Family outdoor group. All the kids are grown up and we still walk the hills, but not so far or so fast now. So there you have it, that picture marks the beginning of  hiking groups in Ireland.
