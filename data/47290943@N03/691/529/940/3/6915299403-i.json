Mandeville of Anner Castle, near Clonmel, Co. Tipperary.\n\nOn really close inspection, think that Poole Photographic Studios gave Miss Mandeville what looks like a school text book to pose with...\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner/\" target=\"_blank\">John Spooner</a></b> went well above and beyond the call of duty on this one, as there's quite a convoluted history to the Mandeville family. Most importantly however, we now know that W. stands for Winifred. See the comments below for details, but here's a summary from John:\n&quot;<i>1889 Winifred Mary Mandeville born at Woolwich, the third of 3 sisters\n1890 Her mother dies\n1895 Her father marries again and they go on to have another 5 children\n1920 She is photographed in a magnificent hat by A H Poole\n1920 She marries a doctor, Henry Barton Owens and he starts practising in Northamptonshire\n1921 Her husband Henry dies after 6 months of marriage\n1933 She is still alive and hasn't remarried</i>&quot;\n\nWe were also thrilled to hear from <b>BobMandeville</b> who is a nephew of Winifred Mandeville/Owens. It is really lovely to hear from relatives of people in our photos. Bob said:\n&quot;<i>Just to say that I am the son of John Parnell Mandeville, and Winifred Mary Owens was my aunt. Henry Barton Owens kept a diary throughout WW1 in which he put watercolours of the scenes that he saw - my uncle Desmond Mandeville placed this in the Imperial War Museum and this can be seen there if asked for. Some have said that the burning of Anner Castle provided a background for Rebecca (Daphne de Maurier) but this is probably fanciful. There is a view of the castle in the Clonmel library archives dating from 1854 approximately - and the castle has been available for renting for holidays for a number of years. This photograph shows Winifred at her happiest - she retained a glorious sense of humour till she died but there was always a certain sadness - not surprising really. Dr Henry Owens chest never recovered from the poison gas he inhaled when tending gassed soldiers. Winifred met him when he was in convalescence near her cousin (Springfield) in Norfolk.
