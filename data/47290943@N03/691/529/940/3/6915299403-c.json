A quite bizarre, and not a little Gothic, account and it mentions that Miss Mandeville (Winifred? Still unmarried in 1926?) owned the Castle:\n\n&quot;<i>Little further light was thrown on the burning of Anner Castle, Country Tipperary, and the death of the caretaker, a man named Burke, at the inquest which was held yesterday in the harness room of the Castle Yard by Dr. Patrick Stokes, Deputy Coroner.\n\nThe mansion was gutted, save for one wing, and the caretaker was found in the coach-house with the top of his head blown off, and a fowling piece lying across his body. Burke lived alone in the yard lodge near the Castle, which was uninhabited.\n\nThe evidence showed that he was an eccentric man, but a careful and devoted servant. He was very suspicious, and when the staff of servants were at the Castle during the residence of the family, he fancied that attempts were made to put powder in his plate, and used to change places with the others at the table. During his seven years at the Castle it was said that he never went to Mass, but upon his body were found some religious books. There was also a deposit receipt for \u00a343, lodged in the bank on October 1st, and apparently he had hoarded his wages, and then decided to put them away.\n\nMr. O'Brien, solicitor for Miss Mandeville, who owned the Castle, said that the affair was a mystery, and would remain a mystery, but he submitted that it was quite evident that Burke's mind had become unhinged and that he took his life.\n\nMr. Reilly, solicitor for the next-of-kin, asked the jury to return an open verdict. He contended that there was no direct evidence to show how the wound was inflicted.\n\nThe jury found that death was due to shock, caused by a gunshot wound, self-inflicted, during temporary insanity.\n\nSuperintendent Fitzgerald said that there had been a suspicion that a horse, which was found dead in the stable, had been poisoned, but Mr. Mulcahy, V.S, who examined the animal, said that it died of natural causes, and that there was no sign of poisoning. It was rather strange that the horse was found dead in the stable at the same time that the deceased man's body was found. The animal was seen in a field on the previous evening all right.</i>&quot;", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-6915299403-72157629095911962", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6915299403/#comment72157629461333651", "realname": "", "path_alias": "johnspooner", "author": "29809546@N00", "iconserver": "8104", "datecreate": "1330290570", "_content": "Thanks for that.
