Not that I can \nrecall, at any rate. I commenced work as an apprentice coach painter with John O'Gorman \n&amp; sons, Prior Park Clonmel, for a trial period of one month. Unpaid, of course.\n  It was the largest such establishment in the South of Ireland at the time and one of \nthe most modernly equipped factories in the country. There was a workforce of perhaps \nfifty or so craftsmen and trainees with over a dozen labourers engaged in preparatory \nwork.   \n  Although various makes of horse-drawn two and four wheel vehicles were manufactured \nincluding traps, gigs, jaunting carts, carriages, floats, even dray carts (Andy \nFanning, Albert Street and Johnny Kennedy [Senr.], Bolton Street, both of whom were \nwheelwrights and carpenters, were in charge) the main business of the firm was the \nbuilding of bus, coach, van and lorry bodies. The chassis for these were assembled in \nCork and collected by the firm's mechanics. As there were no cabs on any of the chassis \n(they were built with the bodies in Clonmel), only a wooden bench lashed behind the \nsteering wheel, the wretched drivers barely survived the journey from the South in the \ndepths of winter. Good old days,how are you!\n  MOMENTARY DIGRESSION\n  Allow me to digress for a few moments. \n  The Irish Omnibus Company, predecessor of the CIE bus servis, was established just a \nfew years previously and the firm of John O'Gorman &amp; Sons was so well-known and \nrespected at the time that it was asked to tender for the building of the new fleet. \nAfter long and serious negotiations the contract was eventually won by Inchicore Works \nin Dublin which was already engaged in the production of railway carriages. They added \na new plant to the already extensive works to cater for the new omnibus services.\n  That's how near Clonmel came to building the bus fleets of the country.  \n  There was one privately owned local service with a fleet of three 22-seaters fitted \nwith big powerful Mercedes Benz engines. These plied between Clonmel and Thurles; \nClonmel-Tipperary, and I'm not quite sure that Carrick was included in some of the \nweekday services. However, this company went burst (liquidation) after a few months and \nthe vehicles were stored in the Prior Park Works when I was there.  \n  Harry Bushe of Wolfe Tone Street and a partner came along shortly afterwards and got \nthe service going again. When the partner pulled out, Harry, renaming the fleet as \nPrincess Bus Service, bravely kept the wheels turning until, through lack of capital \njust when things were picking up, he sold the company to Bob Campion, who had a pub in \nIrishtown.\n   BACK TO O'GORMANS\n   Now let us get back to O'Gorman's and the men who worked there.\n   Discipline was strict. I saw two young men suspended for a fortnight for kicking a \nmatch box along the ground as they walked to their work benches, after lunch. A couple \nof minutes late and you were docked a quarter of an hour's pay. Smoking was prohibited \nand visits to the toilet were monitored. We worked 50 hours a week.  \n   When my probationary month was up I was paid 7/6d per week. After ten hours overtime \none week I received an extra one shilling and three pence! Craftsman, after an \napprenticeship of seven years, were required to work another two years as improvers \nbefore being recognised as fully qualified journeymen. They were then paid \u00a32 18S 6d, \nthe full rate.\n   When a work order was received from the office it went first to the machine shop \nwhere Paddy Phelan, Ard na Greine, was overseer. He was a natural mechanic and could \nanticipate machine trouble almost before it occurred. His assistant was Mick Cooney of \nthe Old Bridge, who was equally expert.\n   THE COACH BUILDERS\n   The timber was then passed to the coach builders. The man in charge here was Andy \nRyan, late of 26 Slievenamon Road. His crew included Tommy Cramp, Davis Road; Charlie \nJohnson, Coronation Row; Johnny O'Donnell, Clerihan; Dan and 'Specs' McGrath, Bridge \nStreet.\n   The next team to take over were the coachsmiths, which included 'Chilly' Hyland, \nWilliam Street; Jimmy Whelan, Bolton Street; and Mickey Foley, Queen Street. The panel \nbeaters, led by big genial Bill O'Brien, who came from around Cloneen were next. They \nincluded Pat Fox, Kickham Street; Tom Morris, Fethard Road and Jim Williams, St. Mary's \nPlace (formerly of Heywood Road) who was later our country senior football goalkeeper.\n   The penultimate operation was the upholstery work carried out by Johnny Brainey (I \nforgot where he lived); Tommy Wallace, who resided in Davis Road and Johnny Powell of \nFethard  Road and Ard na Greine.\n  TO THE PAINTERS\n  The job was finally put in the hands of the painters, neat, natty, little men led by \nWillie Green (Tommy and Bernie's father) who lived in Queen street at the time. Members \nof his team were Mossy Keating (his son is now a well known house painter in town); \nMickey Lonergan (also expert in the art of french polishing), Rivers Street; Paddy \nHickey, St. Mary's Place (who saw to it, that I didn't get into too much trouble), and \nPaddy Kearney, Irishtown. \n   Incidentally, the first mechanical paint sprayer outside Dublin and Cork was \ninstalled at O'Gorman's during my sojourn with the firm. The apparatus was run off the \nback wheel of a jacked up Model T Ford for many months before an electric motor was \ninstalled.\n  I must return to this subject again in another article, as about this period in time, \nthe horse and cart, as a means of transport, was steadily being replaced, by \nmechanically propelled vehicles, and the smaller family coach building firms dotted \naround the country, unable to accept the change, perished one by one.", "authorname": "Desktop 123", "id": "47267889-6981826602-72157629946555175", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6981826602/#comment72157629961826529", "realname": "Sarah", "path_alias": "sarahkmc", "author": "32149975@N07", "iconserver": "3030", "datecreate": "1336117073", "_content": "Well done Carol. it was a  great pleasure to check the photos every day!", "authorname": "Sarah K Mc", "id": "47267889-6981826602-72157629961826529", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6981826602/#comment72157629964807947", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1336152270", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahkmc] Oh thank you!
