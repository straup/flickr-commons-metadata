They are both near the foot of Mangerton, within half a mile of the Torc Waterfall \u2013 the most beautiful of the Killarney Falls \u2013 and on the direct route to the Upper Lake, and the \u201cnew line\u201d to Kenmare. Their situation therefore is highly advantageous, being equally \u201cconvenient\u201d to the three lakes; but \u201cthe view\u201d is excluded by the tall trees of Mr Herbert\u2019s demense.</i>&quot;\n\nAnd the man is still unidentified, and our date is very speculative...\n\nDate: Circa 1900?\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000290467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OCO 32</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4767", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1374054450", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1331899271"}, "originalsecret": "a461ff4fa7", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7036", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6987023089/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
