The peaked &quot;forage&quot; cap came into use about then in Dublin and the helmets were dispensed with.  In those days there was a distinction between those Garda\u00ed who were based in Dublin and outside.  Those in Dublin were Dublin Metropolitan Garda\u00ed and had a separate run for promotion etc.  Right up to the late 70's the old DMP/DMG register was in use to record the names of all those who served in Dublin!
