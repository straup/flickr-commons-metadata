And I'm still wondering what is going on with the further background - to the back left it looks like some larger buildings that are very out of proportion.\n\nAnyway, I think the question raised over the Holborn viaduct is answered by the fact that the church is just south-east of Holborn Circus and as such it would be just out of shot to the left. In fact I suspect that what we can see coming into the shot from back-left is likely the back of where Newgate Street starts, at the end of what is now the viaduct. It also means that I don't *think* the tower of City Temple would be quite in shot either, if it were post 1874, so it's really hard to get any dating clues on this!\n\nOut of interest, has anyone found the address and any dates for Stokes Leather Warehouse?

I had seen that image, but couldn't work it out. But prompted by you I've had a closer look - the church in that image is The Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Musicians' Church) along Newgate St. This thoroughly confused me until I realised that the caption on that image is incorrect - Stokes LEather Warehouse is *far-right* - it's the building propped up, and comparing it with this iamge you can see the same architectural details. So that means the buildings to the left of it (as we look at the image) were knocked down when they built the viaduct, dating this to no later than ca 1865 (assuming they would have to knock them down fairly near the start of the building works, which lasted from 1863-69).\n\nSo I now realise that what I thought was the back of the properties on the south side of Newgate St are actually the fronts of the north side, and the intersection of Holborn/Newgate St and Farringdon St is just off by no more than a few metres to the left of the image.", "authorname": "whatsthatpicture", "id": "47267889-8096307482-72157631792740174", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8096307482/#comment72157631792943063", "realname": "", "path_alias": "whatsthatpicture", "author": "24469639@N00", "iconserver": "3790", "datecreate": "1350498879", "_content": "I also should have added, full credit to [http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] for his original thoughts on the viewpoint, direction and suggestion of such an early date.\n\n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Carol, any chance you could post the full stereoview?
