The station was one of three in a small area that controlled all communication with Great Britain and America and in troubled times it fared well, as all sides respected its contribution to the economy.  Nevertheless, it came under hostile control and wasn't always considered a safe 'married quarters.'  The General Ward was dispatched to evacuate all women and children until peace was restored.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "47267889-5622380883-72157629191571822", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5622380883/#comment72157629559869115", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331466013", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosskayree] When was that, the danger time?", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-5622380883-72157629559869115", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5622380883/#comment72157629198019640", "realname": "Mossy Carey", "path_alias": "mosskayree", "author": "69587809@N05", "iconserver": "7030", "datecreate": "1331491903", "_content": "1922, after Erskine Childers had censored or authorised the dispatches passing through. The exterior of the building is the same today as it was then and all houses within it are occupied. They were offered to resident employees around the early sixties for \u00a3500.00 each and some thought they were too dear!! They have long gardens reaching to the road so far in front towards the sea that the entire garden lengths aren't shown in this picture.  Lawrence possibly set up his camera on the road wall and note the man, almost lost in the garden, looking down towards the camera.\n\nOn a lighter note, do you sleep at all, Carol?
