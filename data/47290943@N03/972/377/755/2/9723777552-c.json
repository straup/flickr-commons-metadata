A tricky choice, but the Aberdeen Weekly Journal, Wednesday, August 25, 1880 was on hand with advice in an article entitled 'Ladies and Spectacles', from which this is an extract:\n<blockquote>When women dislike each other they have a method of staring at one another through their spectacles which conveys more meaning than it would be possible for language to express. Glasses rarely increase the benignity of the countenance, but women can look through spectacles with a disagreeable expression which is beyond the power of the male sex. We have observed that many short-sighted ladies who never use glasses before men , make unblushing use of the most uncompromising spectacles when they are, or imagine themselves to be, exclusively in the company of their own sex. At any rate they will often use an eye-glass or <i>pince-nez</i> in general society, but wear regular spectacles amongst women. The <i>pince-nez</i> has become wonderfully fashionable of late years. If you place one alongside of a pair of spectacles on a table both appear equally harmless, but upon the nose the effect is extraordinary. It is amusing to meet a person whom one is accustomed to see in regular spectacles wearing <i>pince-nez</i> for the first time. You hardly recognise your friend. The face looks half-clothed, and it wears a rollicking expression which is in strong contrast to the sobriety of its old spectacled days. </blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-9723777552-72157635481934514", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9723777552/#comment72157635474920539", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1378905305", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Priceless!  \n\n<b>:</b>8-)", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-9723777552-72157635474920539", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9723777552/#comment72157635482509954", "realname": "Paul O'Farrell", "path_alias": null, "author": "33577523@N08", "iconserver": "7438", "datecreate": "1378907011", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley/] Yes Dobbyn &amp; McCoy are still in business, I'm a client of theirs at the moment.\nCarol the Cove shop was close by, a favourite place to buy sweets when we were children, always loved the front of the building, its now an  <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Waterford,+Ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.247615,-7.084867&amp;spn=0.000015,0.002224&amp;sll=37.269174,-119.306607&amp;sspn=5.017431,17.20459&amp;oq=waterford,&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Waterford,+County+Waterford,+Ireland&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.247621,-7.084928&amp;panoid=9kcxzKbtk0yKvS81zZB6Kw&amp;cbp=12,341.5,,1,2.01\" rel=\"nofollow\">off license</a> I believe, the Cove Bar is still there next door.
