At the head of the glen, there is a waterfall of one hundred feet high, which, as it shoots its whole length in one unbroken jet, produces a grand effect.</i>\n</blockquote>\n\nPS - Thanks for Synge link!", "authorname": "EnniskerryHistory", "id": "47267889-5832327375-72157627271094622", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5832327375/#comment72157627147392117", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1311541778", "_content": "How lovely! &quot;... the river below foaming, and singing, and dashing on its way...&quot;\n\nAnd there's a whole set of various reading lessons from Synge's Glanmore Estate in our Ephemera Department!
