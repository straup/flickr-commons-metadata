Indeed, a model of the ancient city gate at Leeson-street-bridge is the only example of that kind of edifice. But behind these substantial and by no means alway satisfactory efforts every conceivable thing has been done, and done with haste. The very statues have been dressed and washed, and, as is notorious, the statues in Dublin are very fine. Nelson on a colossal pillar dominates Sackville-street or O'Connell-street - it bears both names in common parlance - and from Nelson to the houses on either side depend great strings of flags. Father Mathew, virgin white, stands behind Nelson, and at the other end of the street stands the huge statue of O'Connell, which was being carefully cleansed this morning. On either side of the roads were masts with interlacing festoons of parti-coloured rosettes and flags without number. ... O'Connell's bridge promises to be a glory in the way of illuminations, which the waters of the Liffey, in spite of their dull and malodourous nature, will reflect from their surface</i>\n\nThe visit was not without controversy - Dublin corporation refused to have anything to do with the visit. The Times (London) July 22nd 1903 the following day describing the procession itself: \n\n<i>Above the city end of the bridge towered the simulacrum of the ancient city gate, and beyond it was a stand thronged with people. Here the welcome was prodigious, and for a moment those who saw it were reminded of Queen Victoria's State entry of 1900. But they were reminded of it in a very unpleasant fashion. Today, as then, the roar of cheers from the far side announced the coming of the royal guest some minutes before the head of the procession hove into sight. This time, as before, the welcome from the stands and the surrounding throng was grand and inspiring; but this time the formal civic welcome, the picturesque formal incident of the Sovereign to the metropolis of Ireland, was most lamentably conspicuous by its absence.</i>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-7247430400-72157629844431384", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7247430400/#comment72157629844661292", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1337680891", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm</a>\nEdward VII of the United Kingdom. \nEDWARDVS VII D:G: BRITT: ET TERRARUM TRANSMAR: QV\u00c6 IN DIT: SVNT BRIT: REX F:D: IND:IMP\n(To be read: Edwardus Septimus Dei grati\u00e2 Britanniarum et terrarum transmarinarum quae in Ditione sunt Britannic\u00e2, Rex, Fidei Defensor, Indiae Imperator)\nEdward VII, by the grace of God, of the Britains and of the lands across the sea which are in the British Dominion, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.\n\nANN SECVNDO=In the second year of his reign\nTranslation needed for this - \nEXOI TATVS ADES PORTAE PANDVNIVR AMICO\nPORTAE=gate or portal", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "id": "47267889-7247430400-72157629844661292", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7247430400/#comment72157629844661718", "realname": "", "path_alias": "johnspooner", "author": "29809546@N00", "iconserver": "8104", "datecreate": "1337680894", "_content": "I wonder how temporary the arch was.
