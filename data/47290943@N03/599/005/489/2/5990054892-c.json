Very sad - would love to know how many of these men were still part of Copeland crew in 1917...

U-57 lasted until the end of the war when she was surrendered to the French, broken up in 1921 in Cherbourg. The commander von Georg gave up his post in December 1917 so the Copeland must have been his last sinking. He sank six Scarborough fishing trawlers in one day, he asked a prisoner 'Why did you try and run away ? then took some photographs of the prisoners.. The Clyde Shipping Co. did a lot of coast trade. particularly to Waterford, in 1921 they changed their  flag dispensing with the Irish Harp.. The next Copeland served as a Rescue Ship in the Atlantic..
