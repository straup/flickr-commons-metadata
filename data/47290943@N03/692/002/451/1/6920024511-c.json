In the 1920s there was a prolonged debate in the pages of the Motor News to establish who had the first garage and this was resolved in favor of Leslie Porter's garage in Montgomery Street, Belfast which was established in 1899. Another example was the famous coach builders Hutton &amp; Sons in Summerhill, Dublin, who established a garage workshop beside their coach building business when they acquired the Daimler agency, also in 1899. By the way, its a fallacy that many blacksmiths became involved in automobile work. It has been established that this happened to a small extent in Britain but not in Ireland. As cars began to proliferate in the mid-1900s certainly some machine shops turned to work on cars to supplement their income.\n\nI don't see that the distinction in any way takes from Bill Peare's achievement in establishing the garage in Catherine Street. It had a permanent caretaker who lived on the premises and was thus available at any hour of the day or night to arrange for the needs of motorists to be catered for. It had a restroom for motorists and a rooftop garden and employed the latest machinery and mechanics trained in the repair of automobiles.
