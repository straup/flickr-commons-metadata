However in the 1860s this side of the business was given up to make room for the expanding whisky business. In 1869 the Royal Irish Distilleries were built next to the railway marshalling yard outside the Great Victoria Street Station. Coal and grain were brought by railway to the distillery's own sidings, and the railway carried the whisky away.\n\nThe Royal Irish Distilleries were described in detail by Alfred Barnard in his book \u2018Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom\u2019, published in 1887. The entrance was an impressive gateway and the red brick buildings, most of which were four storeys high, covered seven acres. Near the middle a one hundred and sixty feet high chimney dominated the whole area. Four hundred and fifty men worked in the distillery. In addition to the warehouses at the distillery, the company also had bonded warehouses covering thirteen acres in Adelaide Street, Alfred Street and Clarence Street, and duty-paid warehouses in Alfred Street and Franklin Street. Fifty clerks worked in the main offices in Calender Street, which also housed the Board Room and the luxurious apartments for the use of the Directors.\n\nBarley delivered by train and horse-drawn carts to the distillery was examined on the receiving floor of the Granaries before it was hoisted by elevators to the other floors for storage. The Granaries could hold two hundred and fifty thousand bushels of grain and when Alfred Barnard visited the distillery, two hundred thousand bushels were being stored there. The other major ingredient of whisky is water, whose mineral and chemical properties influence the flavour. The water was supplied from Lough Mourne, twelve miles away, and in the distillery there were two wells one hundred and sixty feet deep.", "authorname": "billh35", "id": "47267889-10795616516-72157637629148786", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10795616516/#comment72157637635825435", "realname": "-", "path_alias": "gerryward", "author": "8214568@N08", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1384363338", "_content": "Towards the end of the nineteenth century it was believed that the flavour of the whisky in Dunville\u2019s extensive bonded warehouses in Adelaide Street was being impaired by the peal of the bell in nearby <b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gerryward/909657354\" target=\"_blank\">St Malachy\u2019s Roman Catholic Church</a></b>.  <b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Craig,_1st_Viscount_Craigavon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Craig</a></b> (future first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland) worked for Dunville\u2019s \u2013 his father was a director there.
