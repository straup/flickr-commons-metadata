The paragraph originally read:-\n&quot;The hair of the head will be kept short. The chin and under lip will be shaved, but not the upper lip. Whiskers, if worn, will be of moderate length.&quot;</blockquote>\n\nI suspect that those who appear clean-shaven have what the Times describes later in the article as the &quot;newly joined ploughboy's youthful wisp of straw-coloured hair&quot;, or perhaps the photo was taken shortly after the amendment to King's Regulations, and few had taken advantage of their new freedom to choose.\n\nLooking at some of the examples of face-furniture I can't help agreeing with the Times that \n<blockquote>its compulsory growth by clean-shaven civilians on joining the Army must have often gone against the grain. More than one pattern has evolved of late; and the now permissible clean sweep of the razor over the upper lip every morning will probably occupy less time than some of the niggling operations which the latest developments render necessary.</blockquote>\n\nOn Dec 28th 1916 the London Times published an article entitled &quot;Christmas at the front. A day's experience&quot;, which must have been experienced at Christmas 1915.
