In 1901, they had 3 daughters living with them, and in 1911, three sons.  Maybe the three children are Kathleen's 3 girls, Constance, Ethel and Maria, or some combination of her boys and girls, or just a mess of cousins.", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-6659820851-72157629873948654", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6659820851"}}
