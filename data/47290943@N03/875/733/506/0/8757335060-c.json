The Barracks were erected in 1806 by the late Abraham Hargrave Esq. and were later named 'Victoria Barracks', in 1922 they were renamed 'Collins Barracks'. In 1837 there was accommodation for 156 officers, 1994 men and 120 horses. The barracks included a 120 bed hospital and there was also a separate 130 bed military hospital in the southern suburbs. These barracks extended in 1849 and named after Queen Victoria who visited Cork in that year, are now called Collins Barracks. Hargrave's designs included long ranges of buildings which could accommodate over 2000 men. [T. F. McNamara, p. 69] \nThe Barracks building is important from an architectural point of view as an example of perfect scale and proportion, in Georgian Architecture. The Barracks is organized around a large square parade ground which is considered to be one of the finest in the country.</i></blockquote>", "authorname": "ccferrie", "id": "47267889-8757335060-72157633526113201", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8757335060/#comment72157633542000614", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77199267@N03", "iconserver": "7180", "datecreate": "1369045527", "_content": "This seems like a more accurate family tree of the Hargraves <a href=\"http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/818/HARGRAVE-JOSHUAHARRISON\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dia.ie/architects/view/818/HARGRAVE-JOSHUAHARRISON</a>\n\nJoshua Harrison Hargrave was the eldest son of Abraham Addison Hargrave and not to be confused with his uncle Joshua Addison Hargrave!", "authorname": "ccferrie", "id": "47267889-8757335060-72157633542000614", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8757335060/#comment72157633542015292", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1369045690", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/77199267@N03] Thanks Ciaran!

A couple of notes from me:\n* DATE - I am fairly certain that the Barracks museum lads got the date on this right. Another book I have also has this pic. And also dates it to 1897.\n\n* BARRACKS/SQUARE - There is a lot written about the Barracks, but a great source is &quot;The Barracks: A History of Victora/Collins Barracks&quot; you'll find it in <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000044313\" rel=\"nofollow\">Library Towers</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Barracks-History-Victory-Collins/dp/1856351947\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> (Pic on front shows Union flag being lowered prior to handover. This pic is taken in the square. The &quot;largest in Europe&quot; claim is one of those untested claims that may or  may not be true). The heritage open-day site has great pic of the <a href=\"http://www.corkheritageopenday.ie/thebuildings/militarybuildings/buildings/mainbody,10408,en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">plaque outside</a> the walls which explains that the walls don't actually mark the &quot;real&quot; boundary of the barracks. (So don't even THINK about building yer shack there).\n\n* GATE - This was the main gate for many years. You could throw a stone to my Granny's house from this gate. (Though she wouldn't have liked it if you did). It used to open in &quot;my day&quot;. The new main entrance is now down the hill. I am intrigued by the pile of stones in the pic next to the gate (and the cart used to move them).\n\n* GUARDROOM - Per my note/tag, this was built in 1806. It now houses the smashing <a href=\"http://www.militaryheritage.ie/research/milmuseums/cork/cork.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barracks museum</a>. (See <a href=\"http://www.militaryheritage.ie/research/milmuseums/cork/museum/content/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pics</a>) I must head back up there again some day soon.\n\n* CHAPEL - What we see here is the back of the chapel. Around the front you'll find <a href=\"http://www.irishwarmemorials.ie/html/place-details.php?show=197\" rel=\"nofollow\">various memorials</a> - including one to the 5 members of 4th Infantry who died as a result of an accident in the Glen of Imaal in the 1970s. (<a href=\"http://www.southernstar.ie/News/UN-documents-at-odds-with-armys-version-of-events-2907.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Look it up</a>)\n\n* SOLDIERS - I will have a look at Dan Harvey and Gerry White's book later (to see if they confirm postings in 1897), but I think we are looking at either RIR or Munster Fusiliers\n\n* KIDS - I am in awe of the young fella poking his head around the guard room - to get himself and his mate (likely brother) into the shot.", "authorname": "guliolopez", "id": "47267889-8757335060-72157633542057532", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8757335060/#comment72157633526250779", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1369046673", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/20727502@N00] Fantastic!

I think you are spot-on with all of those. I recon those Buttevant ones are all correctly labelled. And the Fermoy one is also correctly labelled.
