This reports on events in Waterford the previous Tuesday...\n\nFrom <i>Freeman's Journal</i> Wednesday, 25 May 1898:\n\n<blockquote>A magnificent torchlight procession was held last evening in Waterford to commemorate the beginning of the struggle of Nationalist Ireland against English tyranny in '98. It was first decided to fall in with the rest of Ireland, and celebrate the 23rd May at a meeting of the Thomas Francis Meagher Branch Ninety-eight Centenary Association, Waterford. The procession was entirely impromptu, and started at half-past eight, and the utmost order and enthusiasm prevailed. The procession started from the top of Manor street, down the Quay, up Thomas street, into Ballybricken hill, where it terminated.\n\nThe demonstration was one of the largest seen in Waterford for a number of years. The procession was headed by the Parnell Brass Band, after which followed the Thomas Francis Meagher Fife and Drum Band, the Independent Brass Band, and at the end the Robert Emmet Fife and Drum Band. The banners of the United States and France, together with national flags, were carried. The Father Mathew Boys' Brigade, carrying miniature pikes, marched in the rere.\n\nUp the wide quay the magnificent proportions of the procession could be seen, and the torches gave it a most striking appearance. Huge bonfires were lighted on Mount Misery, an eminence overlooking the city, and the Temperance Hall and other places were decorated with lanterns. After the demonstration the people dispersed quietly to their homes.</blockquote>\n\n<b>P.S.</b> [http://www.flickr.com/photos/33577523@N08] the 28th was a Saturday.
