It was possible to row above your grade at that time in the more provincial regattas, if there was no entry for the senior levels  then a crew could go &quot;pot-hunting&quot; and gather a senior trophy against little or no opposition.  However they were then forever locked into the senior grade and could no longer row &quot;Maiden or Junior&quot;!  The big trophy in the centre rear with the seven names is most certainly not a fours trophy but this four could have been part of an eight who won it.
