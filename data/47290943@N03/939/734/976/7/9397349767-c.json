I do know a lot about the Henn family (from Paradise House, Co.Clare, many of them lawyers and judges in Dublin in the C19th).  I am particularly interested in Jonathan Henn, QC (1789-1873, never married, previously at 22 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin) because I have his <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia/9406525822/\">portrait in oils</a> sitting right behind me now, looking over my shoulder at this photo of Bray, where he ended his days.  I have owned (or minded) the painting for about 40 years, and recently started to find out about him (the O'Connell connection is fascinating) - hence my initial interest in this NLI photostream.  \n\nBack to this photo -  I have a suspicion this is late 1920s/early 1930s from the hats - cloche, homburg, and cloth caps.  No boaters (earlier) or trilbys (later?).  There seems to be some kind of class distinction either side of that fence - homburgs this side; cloth caps t'other (speaking generally!).", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-9397349767-72157634861456681", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9397349767/#comment72157634875247400", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1375274979", "_content": "bernard0368 highlights a house to the right of the Bray Head hotel.
