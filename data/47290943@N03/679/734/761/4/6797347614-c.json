Nicholas Murphy, John O'Neill, Bryan Cunningham, senior, Patrick Henneberry, and Paul Caulfield, junior, were indicted for riotous and unlawful assembly. ... Mr. Ryan [Q.C., Prosecutor for the Crown] reviewed the history of the dispute in the bacon trade, and said the pig buyers got it into their heads that they had a sort of vested right to sell direct to the merchants, even though the farmers and others might think it better for their interests that they should not do so. Out of this dispute the unfortunate riots - the savage riots - which they were about to investigate, had arisen. On the 22nd of January the riots reached a culminating point, if they had not done so before, and the result was that whether terrorised or not, the men of Richardson's were afraid to act in the employment, and the merchants were obliged to import strangers to work the Yarra Yarra. They were attacked by a mob of the most violent description, and the police who were protecting them were obstructed and assaulted. He asked the jury, having heard the evidence, to find a verdict of guilty by doing which they would be asserting the law and assisting in putting down violence and outrage.\n\nActing Sergeant Tobin, Cahir, examined by Mr. Cherry [Q.C, Prosecutor for the Crown], described the attack upon the workers at the Yarra Yarra. He saw Henneberry strike one of the men with a stick, and there there was an attack made upon the police. They were struck again and again, and the police were obliged to draw their batons and repel the onslaught. He saw Bryan Cunningham strik a man named Kavanagh several times with a stick and he pursued him. Paul Caulfield said, &quot;Don't mind that man&quot;, and made a stroke at witness. In the melee he got a terrible blow on the nose which broke it.\n\nCross-examined by Mr. Redmond [Defence, and an M.P.] - I presume you are very familiar with the appearance of the city? No; there were two or three hundred people in the crowd, and all I am able to identify are the defendants.\n\nThe jury found Henneberry and O'Neill guilty.
