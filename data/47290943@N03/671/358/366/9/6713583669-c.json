If so, <a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Kilkenny/Rossinan/Greenville/1458611/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> is the Brown family in the 1901 census.\n\nMrs. Brown would be Anna C., and widowed by 1901. She gives her occupation as Former Mill Owner in 1901, and Mill Owner in 1911, while her son John is a Manager at 22 in 1901, and both John and  Arthur are Millers in 1911. \n\nOn the <a href=\"http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,656775,618555,7,9\" rel=\"nofollow\">OS 25&quot;</a> you can see the Corn Mill, and nearby, Greenville Mill House, which is where I think the Browns lived. There is also a Greenville House to the East, which might have been their home, but looks to have been a farm.\n\nSlightly to the south is the much larger Kilcronagh house belonging to the De La Poer family, which we have seen before:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6747858309/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/6747858309_b1cde7fcf6_t.jpg\" width=\"77\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Yes!
