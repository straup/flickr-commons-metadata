I can imagine that the game was very rough as the Welsh lads were all from the mines and factories and tough cookies and Rugby in Cork in those days was for the more privileged members of society.  The Cork crowd were no shrinking violets but the Aberavon lads would have perceived them as &quot;soft&quot;.  The knee protection was probably just that as the game in the pack in those days was very rough with &quot;hacking&quot; as a normal practice though I think that it had been outlawed by then.  Hacking was literally kicking your opponent on the shin to clear him out of your way!
