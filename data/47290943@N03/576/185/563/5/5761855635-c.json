The line was built under the Light Railway Act of 1889, but it could hardly be called so as it\u2019s costly building (\u00a38,800 a mile) required many sections of heavy engineering, like around distant Drung Hill above. Ironically this part of the line mirrored the northern part of the famous &quot;Ring of Kerry tourist route which gets clogged with large slow moving buses in high season, the railway closing in 1960 just before the age of mass transatlantic tourist travel that might have helped prolonged it's potential.\n\nHere's a what remains of the tunnels around the hill, still set above the road for the keen eyed!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/2cme/4953606423/in/set-72157622774794912\">www.flickr.com/photos/2cme/4953606423/in/set-721576227747...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/2cme/4095848764/in/set-72157622774794912/\">www.flickr.com/photos/2cme/4095848764/in/set-721576227747...</a>", "authorname": "2c..", "id": "47267889-5761855635-72157629265464522", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5761855635/#comment72157630992551718", "realname": "Fred Dean", "path_alias": "be216cd1", "author": "49870858@N08", "iconserver": "7310", "datecreate": "1344551025", "_content": "The train has just exited tunnel no. 2, heading to Valentia.
