MARY McANULTY AND THE GREY MAN'S PATH\n\nThe Grey Man's Path is said to run from the shore to the plateau above Fair Head, though many refer to it starting at Marconi's Cottage and going on past Lough Dhu. There are lots of local stories surrounding the Grey Man's Path - one of these tells of a Mary McAnulty who lived beyond Lough Dhu above Fair Head, she always used the Grey Man's Path to come down to the shore for the purpose of collecting dulse at the base of Fair Head.   One evening, she was returning home as usual with a full bag of dulse; along the way she had regular favourite spots to stop and take a  rest from the hard climb, one of these was at the top of the gulley. As she rested there this evening she noticed in the twilight a figure of man approaching along the path, she noticed he had a limp, she paid no heed to him and started out on her way towards Lough Dhu where she would take another rest, the man caught up with her and walk beside her, in politeness Mary exchanged a few words with him about the weather, though she noticed his voice was different and not of the accents she was used too, she noticed too, in the falling light, that the his face was pale and expressionless below his coat hood. She did not want to stare but could almost swear that it was grey,  but paid no more heed to this only to wondered who he was and from where he had come and what ailed him. They reached Lough Dhu and as she sat to take another rest, the stranger sat beside her. It was then that Mary noticed that his hair in the fading light looked a greenish colour and she could not resist but ask him why, he told her it was due to him having lived beneath the waters of Lough Dhu for many years, now this alarmed Mary a wee bit, for she thought he was either intoxicated or deranged, and neither did she care much for.  The stranger said he was very tired and proceeded to rest his head on Mary's dulse bag and his head half ways on her lap and he fell asleep.  Mary for a moment did not know what to do at this behaviour, bewildered she looked around as if to expect someone coming to her aid when she noticed that that the stranger had one foot in the shape of a broken horse hoof, now this  put the fear into her and she squeezed her leg low enough to slip it out from below the strangers head and took off, her quiet steps turning into the thumps of a fearful run as her heart pounded and her mind waiting to be grabed from behind.  As she got a fair distance away and within sight of her home she heard a spine chilling neighing coming from Lough Dhu, then it fell silent.  Mary never came back along the Grey Man's Path at twilight again and every time she passed Lough Dhu she remembered her close encounter. The story goes that she had encountered the devil-horse that lives in Lough Dhu and  wanders along the Grey Man's Path at twilight disguised as a human, waiting to lure some unsuspecting human into the underworld of Lough Dhu. So........ you've been warned!.........especially if you've take too long to walk round to Murlough Bay and twilight falls upon you!!    \nAnd what is Dulse?\n\n  Back", "authorname": "mogey", "id": "47267889-7636645390-72157630727614712", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7636645390/#comment72157630727717936", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1343135517", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Head\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Head</a>\n&quot;Fair Head is a rocky headland at the north-eastern corner of Northern Ireland, in County Antrim.

It has been suggested that this Grey Man is one of the old gods, possibly Manannan, the Irish sea-god. In the Ulster Journal of Arch\u00e6ology for 1858, vol. vi., p. 358, there is an account given of the Grey Man appearing near the mouth of the Bush River to two youths, who believed they would have seen his cloven foot had he not been standing in the water.

You can get the pdf from Google.\n\n\u201cFhir Leith, or The Grey Man\u2019s Path (a fissure in the precipice), viewed either from land or sea, is never to be forgotten; it seems as though some supernatural power, determined to hew for itself a pathway through the wonderful formations that tower along the coast, so that it might visit or summon the spirits of the deep without treading a road made by mortal hands, had willed the fearful chasm that divides the rocky promontory in two\u2026From the cragsmen and boatmen of this wild coast you hear no tales of Faery, no hints of the gentle legends and superstitions collected in the South, or in the inland districts of the North; not that they are a whit less superstitious, but their superstition is, as the superstition of the Sea Kings, of a bold and peculiar character; their ghosts come from out the deep before or after the rising of the moon, and climb, or rather stalk up the rocks, and, seated upon those mysterious pillars, converse together; so that in the fishermen\u2019s huts, they say \u2018it thunders;\u2019 even mermaids are deemed too trifling in their habits and manners for this stupendous scenery, where spirits of the old gigantic world congregate, and where the \u2018Grey Man\u2019 of the North Sea stalks forth, silently and alone, up his appropriate path, to witness some mighty convulsion of nature.\n\nThe cragsmen are chary of their legends; they think the being of another world who made the basaltic columns and masses of crude rock their toys, are not only far too mighty to be trifled with, but to be spoken of; and they whisper of them as if some calamity would be sure to follow if they spoke of them above their breath.\n\n<blockquote>'As sure as there's a sun in heaven!' muttered one of the elders - a keen vigilant-looking person - and he pointed to the fearful chasm with his staff; 'that path was hewn in one night.\n'It was a brave night work,' we observed.\n'Ay, for the like of us; but to the Grey Man it was nothing.'\n'And who <i>is</i> the Grey Man, my friend?'\n'Whisht!-hoo!-there's none living that can tell that; only let any one in their senses look at the whole County of Antrim, from first to last, and say how it comes to be so different from every other part of Ireland, that's all. Fine palaces they made for themselves, them great Say Kings, and great coorts they had, giants of the earth! What else could tare up and destroy, build up and pull down!' </blockquote>\n\nStill, wonderful as it all was, the chasm of the \u2018Grey Man\u2019s Path\u2019 most riveted our attention, looking upwards from our boat, which rose on every billow. \u2018And did you never see the \u2018Grey Man?\u2019\u2019 we inquired of one of the boatmen, who was more eloquent than our cragsman\n\n<blockquote>\u2018God forbid! It\u2019s not that sort I\u2019d be liking to see.\u2019\n\u2018What, did you never even see his shadow?\u2019\n\u2018No, thank God! the likes of him only comes to the place for trouble. I heard say, before the great ship was wrecked of Port na Spania, <i>he</i> was known to have decoyed the vessel in, and that when he \u2018ticed it on to the rocks he floated away to his own berth up there, and clapt his hands, and the strength of the echo of the clap pitched yon rock into the sea from the head-land, as you would pitch a marble.\n\u2018And was he never seen since?\n\u2018It was a year, or maybe two, before \u2018the troubles\u2019 that my father, dodging about in his boat, thinking it best to run into Ballycastle, for it was wintertime, saw, betwixt himself and the setting sun, a wreath of smoke passing over the waters; and, as there were no steamers in those times, smoke was an unnatural thing on the sea; and he rested on his oars, this way, and it rose and fell with the billows \u2013 a pillar of smoke; but, as it drew nearer the coast, it grew into the shape of a giant, folded in its cloak; he could see the plaits of the cloak falling from the head to the feet plainly as he treaded the waters, and the apparition became more palpable when it ascended the cliffs; it assumed, as it were, a solidity of aspect and form, nor did it pause until when nearly beneath where the fallen pillar rests. Above the path it made a pause, and turning around, spread its arms forward, as if imploring either a blessing or a curse! Too well,\u2019 continued the boatman, \u2018was it proved that the prayer was for destruction; that very night, and, as I said, it was about two years before the ruction of \u201998, and there are many who remember it still, that very night, on the east side of Fairhead, the colliers, who had not very long quitted their work there, for the night, were terrified by what they at first imagined to be loud claps of thunder, followed by such clouds of dust, and such raging and foaming of the sea, and such broad flashes of lightning, that they imagined the end of the world was come. Clap after clap, answered by the raging billows and the mad, mad lightning; they crowded together in their cottages, and fell on their knees in prayer \u2013 those who had never prayed before prayed then, though indeed there were but few of that sort among them. In the morning the effects of the Grey Man\u2019s curse were sufficiently plain; rocks had been detached that no earthly power could move, and they had crushed in the collieries, so that more than a thousand tons of coals were buried past recovery. Columns were hurled into the sea, which had stood erect in the sight of heaven since the world was a world. Old men trembled, and while the women asked them what it meant, they looked to see the entire of Fairhead bound into the ocean. It is there still for all that, though who know what might happen if the \u2018Grey Man\u2019 paid it for another visit?\u2019\u201d </blockquote>", "authorname": "f.macfhearaigh", "id": "47267889-7636645390-72157635090893099", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7636645390/#comment72157635227064112", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1377435915", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/95431395@N05] Thank you!", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-7636645390-72157635227064112", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7636645390/#comment72157635292886727", "realname": "Fionnt\u00e1n McCarry", "path_alias": null, "author": "95431395@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1377859640", "_content": "No problem NLI!
