There was one advert which also listed Seven Guinea Ale and Five Guinea Ale. I'm guessing that the ten guineas refers to the the amount of duty payable (per firkin?), and that the duty was introduced in about 1860, because most of the adverts are from 1860-61. Interestingly most of the later adverts (1889ish) are in Scottish newspapers, and in Scotland they still have 50/- and 70/- ale.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89773100@N02/8383920246/\" title=\"10guinea by JS presscuttings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8473/8383920246_a660bd44ce_o.jpg\" width=\"263\" height=\"84\" alt=\"10guinea\" /></a>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/89773100@N02/8383920410/\" title=\"10guinea_2 by JS presscuttings, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8383920410_26a4b46107_o.jpg\" width=\"266\" height=\"70\" alt=\"10guinea_2\" /></a>\n\nEdit: it seems my guess about the duty was wrong,.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-8382251621-72157632530253294", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8382251621/#comment72157632530596660", "realname": "Paul Clerkin", "path_alias": "archiseek", "author": "7922758@N06", "iconserver": "8156", "datecreate": "1358262492", "_content": "There's a bit on these buildings at Archiseek\n<a href=\"http://www.archiseek.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=6813&amp;start=650\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archiseek.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=6813&amp...</a>", "authorname": "archiseek", "id": "47267889-8382251621-72157632530596660", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8382251621/#comment72157632565835541", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1358700695", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Thanks for the warning about the word 'bosom', but still had to reach for the smelling salts and have a little sit down!", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8382251621-72157632565835541", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8382251621/#comment72157632570303938", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1358701064", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/archiseek] That's a great thread, thank you!
