Very nice indeed.\n\nO'Briens is indeed now The Roost.\n\nThe hardware shop looks to be where Dawson's is now.  \n\nThe grey stone building in the middle of the frame was the Leinster Arms and is now Mantra nightclub.  It's marked as a hotel on the OSI 25&quot; map.\n\nThe young trees are presumably the same mature trees that are still on the street.  You can just about see the gates to Carton Avenue at the other end of Main Street.\n\nThe shop with the &quot;Tea&quot; sign outside it is around where Abrakebabra is now.  The car looks to be parked outside where Supermacs is.  Maximus and Mizzonis look to be just houses in this picture.  (There are a lot of fast food places in Maynooth!)\n\nThe Garda Station is just out of the frame on the right, and faces O'Briens.  It's marked on the OSI map as Con. Bk, presumably Constabulary Barracks, so it's been doing the same job for a while!\n\nNot in the photo, but on the map, Manor Mills corn mill is where Manor Mills shopping centre is now (vaguely remember the mill before it was knocked for the shopping centre).\n\nBehind the men standing outside Mantra, it looks like another business premises on the corner.  That would be Brady's today.  i wonder was it Brady's then.\n\nIt's surprising how little some parts of the street have changed.", "authorname": "Joefuz", "id": "47267889-8380163166-72157632521387906", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8380163166/#comment72157632521667586", "realname": "", "path_alias": "joefuz", "author": "7945368@N05", "iconserver": "1149", "datecreate": "1358171584", "_content": "Can't find any O'briens as shop keepers in the census.
