A train cannot enter the single line section unless the driver is in posession of an appropriate staff ( also called a token in some systems). Said staffs are dispensed from the instruments, which  requires the signalmen at each end of the section to press buttons at the same time, and placed in those loop holders for easier transfer to the train crew. Another staff for the same section cannot be issued until the first staff has been replaced in the staff instrument at the other end of the section.
