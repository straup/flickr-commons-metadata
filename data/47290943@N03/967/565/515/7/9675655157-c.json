Numerous oral traditions were later collected about this episode, principally in the 1930s by the historian <b>Richard Hayes</b> and by the Irish Folklore Commission.&quot;  Richard Hayes was Director of the National Library of Ireland from 1940-1967, and a very interesting man! Here's just one example (from the <i>Dictionary of Irish Biography</i>):\n\n<blockquote>Soon after the outbreak of the second world war, he was seconded from his post as head of the National Library to work as code-breaker with the Irish army. His skills in linguistics, combined with his highly organised mind and fine memory, led to considerable successes in this field, which included the foiling of an attempt by the German agent Hermann Goertz to establish a power base in Ireland. Although deeply involved in intelligence work (and also, during this period, carrying out scientific experiments on the culture of plants), Hayes continued to administer the Library.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9675655157-72157635392092422", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9675655157/#comment72157635392121756", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1378368553", "_content": "Memorial of the battle (photo by dr_urbanus):\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21212853@N08/8593622362/\" title=\"Ballinamuck Pikeman by dr_urbanus (Martin), on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8593622362_d6dfc200b3_t.jpg\" width=\"73\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Ballinamuck Pikeman\" /></a>\n\nStreetview: <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:53.866667,-7.716667&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.865017,-7.717316&amp;spn=0.011072,0.033023&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.865228,-7.717321&amp;panoid=_Q62F1N8JAzE5BmNrnevIA&amp;cbp=12,49.82,,0,6.48\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:53.866667,-7.716667&amp;hl=en&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "47267889-9675655157-72157635392121756", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9675655157/#comment72157635392122418", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1378368558", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Was it Richard Hayes that saved the Laurence collection from becoming a glass house?", "authorname": "OwenMacC", "id": "47267889-9675655157-72157635392122418", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9675655157/#comment72157635392125922", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1378368574", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Saw your lock out exhibition yesterday - I would recommend it to all and sundry", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9675655157-72157635392125922", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9675655157/#comment72157635384935317", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1378369142", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley] I see from your link that Wolf Tones brother was captured and hanged after the battle.\n\n96 French officers and 748 men were taken prisoner.

Occasionally we lose! </b>\n\nCastlebar, 1798.\nThe Irish rebellion of 1798 was, in some respects, fuelled and inspired by the successes of the French Bourgeois revolution of 1789. Ireland was under the control of London and in 1798 several large uprisings took place across the country; each one was ruthlessly crushed by the British army. The Irish rebels appealed to the French government for military aid (France and Britain were at war at the time) and in August several thousand French troops landed in Ireland. Joined by Irish irregular forces they fought the British at Castlebar. The British defeat at Castlebar became known as &quot;The races at Castlebar&quot; because of the ease with which the numerically superior British (accounts differ dramatically over the number of French and British troops that were at Castlebar. Patriotic Irish historians may well have massaged the figures over the years) routed from the battle after a Franco-Irish charge. There was always a certain unease in the alliance between the French and the Irish and the rebellion didn't last much longer as the British defeated the French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck (also in 1798).", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9675655157-72157635395894330", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9675655157/#comment72157635396136222", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1378393063", "_content": "&quot;Croppies Grave&quot;, Ballinamuck Co.
