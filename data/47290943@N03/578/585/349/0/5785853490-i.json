Smyth and Captain A.P White were killed during a military raid in Drumcondra, Dublin in the early hours of Tuesday, 12 October 1920. Their funeral procession along the quays in Dublin was a huge affair, with their remains in coffins placed on gun carriages and covered with Union flags, and escorted by up to 600 troops.\n\nHere's a snippet from the <i>Irish Times</i> published the next day:\n&quot;Right along the quays the procession marched to the strains of the Dead March in &quot;Saul&quot; and other solemn airs. On arrival at Store street the remains of Major Smyth, accompanied by one portion of the troops, were conveyed to the Great Northern Railway Station at Amiens street, where they were entrained for removal by the three o'clock train to Banbridge, where the concluding stage of the funeral takes place to-day.\n\nAs the coffin was borne from the gun carriage to the mortuary van the troops gave the customary salute, and the &quot;Last Post&quot; was sounded by the buglers. On the coffin was laid a beautiful wreath from two brother officers of the deceased.\n\nThe remains of Captain White, accompanied by the remaining troops, were then conveyed to the North Wall, where, after being accorded the usual military salutes, they were placed on board the steamer for England.&quot;\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 14 October 1920\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000217985\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOG150</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4773", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1920-10-14 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382623282", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1306918728"}, "originalsecret": "fbb5457341", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "painted blue today - see Google maps", "author": "38401430@N06", "h": "131", "authorname": "billh35", "w": "40", "y": "45", "x": "315", "id": "72157630542732132"}, {"_content": "31 Bachelor's Walk.
