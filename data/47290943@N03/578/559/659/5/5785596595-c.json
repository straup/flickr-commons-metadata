In the 25&quot;, the building to the left has the modern door at an angle on the corner, and the building to the right is in line with it (this is the sacristy of the church, which I think from that webpage above was finished in 1895).\n\nSo, I'd say this is John's Lane, and that the modern buildings were built between 1888 and whenever the 25&quot; survey happened, generally around 1900.
