The commercial and editorial offices, the latter containing many valuable historical books and records of Waterford County and City, as well as stores containing hundreds of pounds worth of paper, were completely destroyed. The Civic Guards were quickly on the scene, with members of the newspaper staff. The City Fire Brigade succeeded in saving all the machinery and type. The damage, however, is estimated at several thousands, and is not wholly covered by insurance.&quot;\n\nUnsure of the location of the Waterford News at this time, so if anyone knows, please speak up...\n\nDate: 1 September 1923\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/P_WP_3120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">P_WP_3120</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4897", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1923-09-01 09:38:53", "lastupdate": "1374054399", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1314865248"}, "originalsecret": "50e54c69b4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6207", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6102097031/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
