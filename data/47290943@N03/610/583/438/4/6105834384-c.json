It took until 1938 before a suitable four-engined floatplane was designed to Mayo's design and at the same time an existing Shorts flying boat was modified to act as the launch platform. The smaller mail carrier was named Mercury and the larger launch flying boat Maia. \nIn July 1938 Mercury was launched over the River Shannon and flew direct to Montreal with 2,200 pounds of mail. However, the British Air Ministry, who had partially funded the experiments, decided there was no future in the project, and although Mercury was launched by Maia late in 1938 on two flights to Alexandria carrying Christmas mail, that was the end of the experiment.", "authorname": "Bob Montgomery 2012", "id": "47267889-6105834384-72157629124132268", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6105834384/#comment72157629126830310", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1330639169", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/75421485@N08] Any idea what happened to them, Bob?
