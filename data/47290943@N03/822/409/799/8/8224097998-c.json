A few years later they successfully appealed to the Guardians of the South Dublin Union for some finance (it cost \u00a310 to keep a girl for a year), though the Irish Times in an editorial frowned upon this proselytising by &quot;Romanists&quot;, while they lauded the efforts of the Protestant-run &quot;Home for Orphans&quot; at 7 South Richmond Street (which advertised frequently for &quot;fresh souls to save&quot; in the same newspaper).[10]\n\n \n&quot;The Portobello Hotel, and, facing it, the Grand Canal Tavern, 19th centuryTen years later the Asylum was sold to a Mr. Isaac Cole, who renovated it and returned it to its original function as a hotel, to accommodate 100 persons. It was popular among officers visiting the nearby Portobello Barracks (who would occasionally pop across South Richmond Street to the Grand Canal Tavern for a drink) and claimed it was the nearest hotel to the RDS grounds. However, it was slow in providing catering facilities - in 1871 a Rathmines businessman, in a letter to the Irish Times, lamented the absence of restaurants in the neighbourhood, and enjoined upon Mr. Cole to provide same, preferably a two-course meal for two shillings (the price to include beer and punch).[11] In the 20th century the building became a nursing home&quot;", "authorname": "Vab2009", "id": "47267889-8224097998-72157632115311272", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8224097998/#comment72157632115320670", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1354025215", "_content": "Black &amp; White Blended Scotch Whisky was first produced in 1884. <a href=\"http://www.whisky.com/brands/blackandwhite.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.whisky.com/brands/blackandwhite.html</a>\n\nSo between 1884 and 1948?
