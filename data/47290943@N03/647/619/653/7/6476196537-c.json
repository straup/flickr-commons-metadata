The road to the right is Patrick's Close North which no longer exists but ran immediately  to the north of the Cathedral. The building with the posters on it and much of that side of the street was demolished to make way for the park which was completed in 1902. The decision to create the park was taken in 1887 so these buildings would have had their death warrant signed by the time this photo was taken.
