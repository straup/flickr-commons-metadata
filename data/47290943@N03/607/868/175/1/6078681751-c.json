This is one of the most prestigious trophies in  Irish rowing and is also known as &quot;The Blue Riband&quot;.  It was also recognised as the unofficial fours championship of Ireland.  I will send a link to someone in the rowing fraternity and see if they can identify it.  If that is the cup, or 'pot'  as they are known, the the names of the crew are likely to be inscribed on it.  As far as I know Waterford Boat Club are still active and they had a great selection of old photos on display in their clubhouse so they may have the record also?
