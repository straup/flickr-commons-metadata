It may not seem very significant but at a time when the Land Commission courts were beginning to lower rents on the estate under the fair rent fixing terms of the 1881 Land Act, his [Baron Clonbrock] agent feared for the future.

Indeed, big house expenditure at Clonbrock fell by an average of 30 per cent during the period 1882-89, while money spent on the gardens also fell by around 30 per cent.
