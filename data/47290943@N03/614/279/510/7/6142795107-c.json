That's the &quot;Old Cork City Hall&quot;. To clarify:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe <b>Old Cork Customs House</b> is an 18th century building on Emmet Place. (Built 1724 it later became premises of the Royal Cork Institution. The building is still there - now part of Crawford School of Art).\nThe <b>New Cork Customs House</b> was built in 1818 by Abraham Hargrave on Albert Street. (In 1882 it became HQ of the Cork Harbour Commissioners. The building is still there - now home to Port of Cork Company)\nThe <b>Old Cork City Hall</b> (pictured here) was built in the 19th Century on Albert Quay. (Originally a corn exchange it was extended and repurposed for municipal use after the Cork Exhibition. It was destroyed in the burning of Cork in 1920 - and is gone)\nThe <b>New Cork City Hall</b> was built in the 1930s to replace the old structure on Albert Quay. (It was opened in 1936 - and is still there)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe map coordinates are therefore not entirely accurate.
