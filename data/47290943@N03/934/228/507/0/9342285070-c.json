That is interesting, and worth quoting -\n\n<blockquote>\nIt would seem from a paper read before the Institution in November, 1892, that the Alexandra\nGraving Dock at Belfast was opened in 1889, and soon after the completion\nof the work cracks appeared in the concrete, which gradually opened out\nand allowed of the penetration of water charged with saline matters in solu-\ntion. The floor also, which consisted of a bed of concrete 10 feet thick,\nshowed &quot; symptoms of disruption,&quot; and the cracks in the dock walls became\nwider. As the result of expert examination in June, 1890, made at the\nrequest of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners, it was reported that the\ncause of the decay of the concrete was the infiltration of sea water charged\nwith salts of magnesia, which found its way from, the adjacent tidal river\nand penetrated through the sandy backing into the lower part of the con-\ncrete surrounding the dock. The magnesia abstracted the lime from the\nPortland cement, which was conveyed away in an altered form, and the\nconsequent chemical action caused the disintegration of the concrete. The\nremedy proposed was the removal of the ' decomposed concrete, and the\nsubstitution for it of a concrete, rich in cement, which should be as impervious\nas possible, and by this means put an end to the influx of sea water. It was\npointed out in the course of the- discussion on this paper &quot; that it was only\nwhere the concrete walls were subjected to the unbalanced pressure of the\ntidal water that the destructive influences appeared to take effect.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nAt that time they were still experimenting with the use of concrete, particularly in sea water - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#History\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#History</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-9342285070-72157634764984921", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9342285070/#comment72157634771726612", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1374619979", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] I think it must prove that the photograph was taken very soon after the dock was built.
