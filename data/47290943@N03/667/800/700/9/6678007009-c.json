Why have they all (bar 1) got their caps on indoors in a recreation room?  I've worn uniforms for most of my life and one of the first things one does is take the darned cap off and especially in a room such as this.  They are all, more or less, facing the camera which would indicate that it was posed and if so why did the silly beggars insist on moving so much?  The likelihood that an Irish ampersand is used in a religious text in a British army rec room is remote to say the least.  This was a rec room for other ranks i.e privates as there are no officers present and no signs of ranks on the sleeves of tunics as far as I can see.  As regards &quot;Golden SCA text&quot; I expect that it was something like Services Christian Association?  Very interesting indeed!  Another thought struck me, why all the flowers?
