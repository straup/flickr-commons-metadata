They originally carried an ivory livery, as depicted in O'Dea's photo. \nThey were nicknamed 'bubbles' due to their shape, a design which helped prevent the liquid cement from drying during transit. They shouldn't exactly be described as hoppers, as hoppers are usually open wagons. The cement was loaded/discharged from an open top hatch, and by a pipe nearer to the wagon frame.\nDuring the early years of the 'bubbles', a guard's brakevan would be marshalled at the front and rear of the train, as seen in the photo, even though the wagons were vacuum braked. This practice was phased out however by 1970. The train is possibly en-route from the cement works at Athy to the Cabra bulk terminal in Dublin City.
