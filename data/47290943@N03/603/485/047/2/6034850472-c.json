I was in there today myself. From that angle, the chimneypots and roofscape are completely hidden by gorgeous mature trees, but from outside, they do look right! So next step in investigation is finding out if there ever was a structure where the grounds keepers are based now... And an obelisk on top of the mound - certainly not there today.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that it wasn't until the 1970s that Merrion Square was open to the public. Before that it was accessible only to keyholders of the houses around the Square. Need to find out where Countess Markievicz lived in Dublin.
