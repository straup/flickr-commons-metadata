On the other hand I can find quite a few Farrells who emigrated to the US in the latter half of the 19th century.

Did they have two girls and then a boy in the very earliest years of the 1900s?

Household Members: John B McGinley age 37, his wife Joan age 35&quot;\n\nIn 1905 she's still at Eau Galle, St Croix, Wisconsin, with &quot;children Nellie age 12, Agnes age 10, Sylvester age 8, Evangeline age 6, Stasia age 3 and Ketherine age 1.; Household Members: Jno B McGinley age 42, his wife Johanna age 39&quot;\n\nAll of this is from <a href=\"http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/19495798/person/810900612\" rel=\"nofollow\">trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/19495798/person/810900612</a>\n\nWhat is strange is that there is no mention of a husband/father of the children, although in 1910 there's the rather curious entry &quot;Household Members: John B McGinley age 48, his wife James (s/b Joanna) age 48&quot;. Had James left as EastMarple1 suggests?  \n\nIt seems not too great a leap of faith (though that is all it is) to suggest that the image could have been taken about 1901 and shows James and Johanna with Nellie, Agnes and Sylvester, and could that even be John McGinley on the carriage?\n\nEDIT: if James and Johanna were only married in 1905, where does this leave us? If the Johanna is one and the same then she had had three children in the US, possibly with another father given that he is not mentioned, but then came back to Ireland without them. Somehow I'm thinking it's not quite as simple as my hypothesis!", "authorname": "whatsthatpicture", "id": "47267889-6646583737-72157635481984156", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6646583737/#comment72157635474764007", "realname": "", "path_alias": "whatsthatpicture", "author": "24469639@N00", "iconserver": "3790", "datecreate": "1378904334", "_content": "Where next?
