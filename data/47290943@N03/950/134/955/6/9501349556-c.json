She continued to do so for several nights until Hosty consulted a magician, who told him, not to place his fortress there as M\u00f3r N\u00ed Mhananain did not wish it.   \nBut she would be willing to allow him to erect it on the site of her own fort, and so delighted to view so lofty a pile towering over the humble mounds of her ancient fortress, suffered no fairy to interrupt the work.
