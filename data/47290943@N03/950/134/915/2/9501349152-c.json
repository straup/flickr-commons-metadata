As our ticket here is &quot;Under the Patronage and Direction of the Corporation of the City of Dublin, a Dinner at the Rotunda attended by the Lord Mayor of Dublin looks like a better bet??\n\nMeanwhile, up at Stephen's Green (and showing that even 200 years ago, Dublin Corporation were taking stick for &quot;street furniture&quot; decisions:\n<blockquote>The Paving Corporation practised a curious piece of economy on Friday night. They took away all the lamps from Stephen's Green, to obviate even the chance of losing one by an unlucky explosion! The entire square was, of course, in utter darkness after eleven o'clock, though thousands of people straggled about until near sun-rise. There were, in consequence, some occasional immersions into the dyke, pocket-pickings, and encounterings of unruly horses and more unruly riders, but we have not heard of any lives lives being lost. Demi-smotherings, wet-clothes, and broken limbs are of course objects of little consideration, but how would the account stand if the lives of any of the King's subjects had been lost. At one side of the book we should have written, with all clerical formality - &quot;lost three lives&quot; - at the other, &quot;saved three lamps!&quot;</blockquote>\n\nPlus and lastly, I found this on the G.P.O. re Foundation Stone, in <i>The new Picture of Dublin: or Stranger's Guide through the Irish Metropolis...</i>:\n<blockquote>...
