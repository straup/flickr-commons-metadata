The circus was crowded to its fullest extent when one of the keepers, in full view of the audience, opened the door of the animal's cage preparatory to entering. With a sudden bound the lioness leaped through the door and escaped, amid the cries and shrieks of terrified spectators, the majority of whom were children. The beast jumped into the middle of the ring and knocked down a boy named White, tearing most of the skin from his face with her claws. Then she attacked another boy, and wrenched off part of his jacket. The lioness, pursued by the keepers, made another dash, and succeeded in getting out of the enclosure into an adjoining field, where she lay down. Eventually she was lassoed, numerous attendants and a large dog assisting in the capture. </blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-9506150747-72157635062522749", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9506150747/#comment72157635068997898", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1376472468", "_content": "There seem to be a lot of loiterers outside Sloan's the bakers - perhaps they had good sticky buns.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-9506150747-72157635068997898", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9506150747/#comment72157635069170884", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1376473716", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Re the &quot;female&quot; RIC, perhaps it was crazy transcription?
