It seemed to be just getting moved around as space permitted but was never used.  I remember being on it around about 1978/1979 at the age of 15 or 16 with my dad and the most striking feature apart from its size was the most amazing spiral staircase to get into the upper echelons of the crane....I wonder whatever happened to it? Only in recent times I have discovered the crane was made specifically to service the Olympic class liners. Of course now in 2013 when I realise its significance, I can now appreciate in its connection to the workings of the shipyard and am so glad I can say I stood on a tangible part of the history of that era, especially as my great grandfather was chief timekeeper in the yard during the 1912 period.", "authorname": "slapper2010", "id": "47267889-6017884645-72157635251749770", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6017884645/#comment72157635257137182", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1377596385", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/54089282@N02] Thank you for that great comment.

He was working there in 1911 so he would have seen Titanic rise from the ground as she was built and then launched. The thing is though I remember as a child, there was a lot of shame around the shipyard for many many years and no one spoke of Titanic because they had built the &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship and it had sank! My late father was a Union Official on the Engineering Union and he said the same thing. The people who built Titanic were ashamed of what had happened to her. Her popularity now is only due to the wreck being discovered and the movie about her which changed how people viewed the whole disaster.", "authorname": "billh35", "id": "47267889-6017884645-72157635253706535", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6017884645"}}
