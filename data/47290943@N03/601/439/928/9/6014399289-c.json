I'd be happy to think that all the glass damage was caused from within. Also, I'm not convinced that the middle windows are actually damaged? Could that just be odd reflections on the glass? \nPlus, the outside of the building doesn't look like it's suffered any shell damage - if there were shells, they hardly went cleanly through the windows! Finally, I'm not an expert on the War of Independence (1916 is more my area), but I don't think there were any shelling 'incidents' around that time (wide open to correction here...). Interestingly though, I see the pic was taken by Keogh Bros, a local company, so surely they'd know what they were reporting on? \n\nAll in all, though, I blame the safe-blowing... (Finally, I'd guess that the safe was on the top floor - the only floor with all the blinds pulled. Maybe the soldiers pulled them to 'cover' the blasts?)", "authorname": "vandillo", "id": "47267889-6014399289-72157627290648933", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6014399289/#comment72157627293963303", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1313181167", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/65361386@N05] I grant you the explosions might account for the broken windows rather than shelling.
