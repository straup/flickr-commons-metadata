From the entries submitted that of Mr RM Butler, FRIBA was declared the winner and his design was accepted. \n\nMr Butler envisaged a much larger building than the old church. It was to have a high tower standing separate from the the main building with a tapering spire reaching far into the sky. It was to stand immediately south of the present nun's choir. The plan for the tower was not persevered with as it was regarded as too expensive. The church was intended for a much larger congregation and this meant that the site occupied by the old building would not suffice; The Sisters of Mercy in the nearby convent came to the rescue and from their property offered sufficient ground to extend the site so that the work could begin.\n\nThe first task was the clearing of the site offered by the Sisters. There were a number of trees on it which has to be cut down and uprooted and the ground levelled. This work began on <b> 9th April 1907.</b> Granite was to be used in the external facing of the walls of the church. The Mountains of Mourne held the best granite in Ireland and so an order was placed at the quarries of Mr John Rush of Castlewellan, Co. Down, to supply granite which was then transported by sea down the east coast of Ireland round Carnsore Point and along the south coast to Castletown. \n\nWork went on under the pastoral eye of Canon McDonnell during the summer months arid in <b>15th August the Bishop of the diocese, Bishop John Mangan, came to Beara, presided at High Mass in the old church and blessed the foundation stone of the new one. </b>\n\nA very practical difficulty now arose as work on the new church progressed. The old church stood on part of the intended site. Eventually it would have to be demolished but it was needed for Sunday Mass until the new one was ready. <b> It is to the credit of the architect and the contractor Mr Robert Kelly of Bantry that the old church was kept intact and Sunday Masses celebrated there while the new one gradually sprung up beside and around it. </b>\n\nProgress was slow but certain. <b> By Christmas 1910 the building was nearing completion </b>and on Christmas Day, mass was celebrated for the very first time in the new but as yet unfinished church. Seven more months were to elapse before the building was complete and solemnly dedicated for divine worship.\n\n<b>The new church were blessed, formally opened and dedicated to the Sacred Heart on 30th July 1911. </b>The ceremony was carried out with great pomp and splendour. Bishop Mangan presided at the High Mass at which Canon McDonnell was the celebrant. Canon Patrick Hayes, then parish priest of Ballylongford, preached at the ceremony. Canon Hayes was later transferred to Castletownbere and was our parish priest from 1919 until his death in 1925. He is buried in the church grounds.\nIn the course of his sermon Canon Hayes said: &quot;I congratulate Canon McDonnell and his noble flock on this glorious monument of their piety, zeal and self-sacrifice. May this beautiful church be for him and for you the gate that leads to heaven&quot;.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-7465386310-72157630339915992", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7465386310/#comment72157630339969290", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1340967096", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/swordscookie] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gerryward] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley]  Agree Summer 1908 is a good place to start, we should ask [http://www.flickr.com/photos/80413507@N08] if he can make anything more specific from the shadows etc.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-7465386310-72157630339969290", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7465386310/#comment72157630340054322", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1340967734", "_content": "<a href=\"http://garinishisland.wordpress.com/category/first-years/page/3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Have a Look at the photograph on this site, is this our Mr Robert Kelly </a> front and centre with the folding ruler?\n\nRobert Kelly (above), the building contractor, wrote to his niece on 10th December 1910 \u2026 I am just starting work on Garnish Island in Glengarriff Harbour for a Mr. Bryce, brother of the English Ambassador to America.
