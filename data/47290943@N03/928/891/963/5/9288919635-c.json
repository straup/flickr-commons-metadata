Small six-round magazines. 11,000 were supplied by the War Office as a free issue to the RIC between March 1904 and 1914.\n\nThe new carbine was first issued to the Reserve Force at Dublin's Phoenix Park Depot in March 1904, before being distributed across the county forces. It replaced the Martini Henry carbine and at the same time replaced the existing long bayonet with the shorter knife pattern.\nBy July 1904 the new rifle had been issued to counties Cavan and Carlow, and special training regarding the mechanism of the new rifles had been given to the RIC Musketry Instructors. In January 1905 Kings county had been supplied, and it was noted that Morris Tubes had been privately purchased by some of the men for practice. County Monaghan did not take possession of the carbines until April 1905.\n\nIn September 1920 the RIC wrote to the Ministry of Munitions of War to communicate their desire to sell as scrap approximately 10,000 of these carbines, which were to be replaced with the modern SMLE rifle. They were shipped to the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock around November or December 1920, together with around 1.1 million rounds of MkVI ammunition (ref: National Archives file MUN 4/6028).</i></blockquote>", "authorname": "ccferrie", "id": "47267889-9288919635-72157634649408008", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9288919635/#comment72157634643052405", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77199267@N03", "iconserver": "7180", "datecreate": "1373878361", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] I would guess so.
