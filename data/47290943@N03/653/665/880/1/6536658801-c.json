Just a few aspects to point out, all the cars are facing west as the north quays were one way in that direction at that time, that didn't change until after 1978.  The facility was now boarded or galvanised up as it had become a meeting place for (shock horror) gay men and a number of muggings had taken place there.  We're gone away from that abuse of gay people (I hope?)  In the distance you can see the green copper top to the tower in Guiness's and the chimney nearby which I think is gone now?  The Liffey doesn't look too bad but believe me it still stank and was not nearly as clean as it is today!", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-6536658801-72157628481750139", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6536658801/#comment72157628481851325", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1324294330", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/swordscookie] That's terrible about the muggings!
