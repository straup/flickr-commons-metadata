Over a century later, in 1783, the present house was built by Cornelius Bolton, who had inherited the Faithlegg Estate from his father in 1779. Financial difficulties followed and in 1819 the Bolton Family sold the house to the Power Family. Nicholas Mahon Power married Margaret Mahon and her dowry enabled him to buy Faithlegg House and Estate. The Powers were a wealthy merchant family from Waterford City and they adorned the estate with the stags head and cross, which was the Power family crest. It remains the emblem of Faithlegg to this day. On the death of Nicholas Power in 1873 his eldest son, Patrick Joseph (Pat) and his wife, Lady Olivia Nugent came to live in the house and commissioned Samuel Roberts to alter and enlarge the family mansion.\n\nThe house passed to Hubert Power, the only son of Pat and Lady Olivia, and in 1920 upon Hubert\u2019s death, it passed to his daughter, Eily Power. In 1935 Eilyand her husband sold the House to the De La Salle order of teaching Christian Brothers after which it acted as a novitiate until the 1980\u2019s.\n\nThe last remaining gap in history is from the 1980\u2019s until 1998 when it was taken over by the Tower Hotel Group.</i></blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"#//www.munster-express.ie/opinion/views-from-the-brasscock/the-story-of-faithlegg-house/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Munster Express, September 17th 2012</a>", "authorname": "ccferrie", "id": "47267889-6288982454-72157633097106081", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6288982454"}}
