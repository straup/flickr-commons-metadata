Because:\n\n<i>In 1824, Mary Browne, daughter of Edmond and Anne Browne, married Francis Gore and their descendants eventually inherited the Hickman estate by the will of Anne\u2019s brother, Poole Hickman, who died in 1842.

The Gore-Hickman's were clearly a landed family from Clare - where they'd lived for generations.

Records from the 1880s show they had some troubles from the Land League and nationalist neighbours, and the social events (incl. funerals) the family attended suggest a less-than-nationalist leaning for some generations. All the brothers signed-up during the Great War (one not coming home). I imagine Thomas wasn't entirely at ease with the way he saw things going politically on his own return from France (home rule, devolution, etc). He seems to have used his military experience fairly forcefully in several events during the War of Independence. Given all this, the family were effectively burned-out of their properties in Clare. Coupled with the fact that he would've been persona-non-grata in the new order after the war (up to and including being a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selton_Hill_ambush\" rel=\"nofollow\">marked-man for those events in Leitrim</a>), I am not at all surprised to find them heading to England.

I've seen the Beaslai collection and some of the photos are copies of originals, often poor copies, and annotated, as has been noted, on the reverse. It is not clear where they were originally sourced nor who annotated them. This man, a District Inspector in the RIC, may well be Gore-Hickman, but certain aspects of the photo give me cause to doubt. Firstly, the pose and background suggest an earlier period, whereas Gore-Hickman joined the RIC in early 1920. I would expect the composition and lighting to have been much better; more importantly, he seems to be wearing a cross belt plate with the 'early' style crown, suggesting pre-1901. I can't really make out the crown on the helmet plate. So is it him, or has Beaslai assumed it to be him? I would not be certain.\nHis brother's photo is shown in this link - <a href=\"http://www.markhams-of-derryguiha.com/id24.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.markhams-of-derryguiha.com/id24.html</a> - and you may think there is a certain similarity.
