There is absolutely no doubt though, that they are RFA in the 9 button, dark blue full dress tunic, with scarlet collar and yellow worsted braid trim (known as round cord) around the collar and cuffs, with the latter in the form of an Austrian knot.  As a mounted unit (along with RHA), the RFA wore the 'overalls' that you see here, which had a leather strap under the instep of their half wellington boots, with the latter fitted with swan neck spurs.  This full dress uniform was withdrawn upon the outbreak of war in 1914.\n\nI agree with the previous poster that this is very likely to be 145th Field Battery's sergeants and the 'Brigade Sergeant Major' (a warrant officer), pictured outside the Sergeants' Mess.  At that time a group of batteries was known as a Brigade, rather than a Regiment as today.\n\nThe man stood at rear with a horseshoe above his chevrons is the &quot;Farrier (Sergeant) Major&quot;, as he has a large crown surmounting the badge that indicates his sergeant major status.\n\nOf the seated figures, the man at centre is the Brigade Sergeant Major and his status is reinforced by the gold (gilt) braid trimming his collar and cuffs, instead of the yellow worsted worn by the others.  On his flanks sit two other Sergeant Majors, one for the Battery and the other for the Orderly Room.  There badge of rank was the same and, until 1915, they were not of warrant officer grade.
