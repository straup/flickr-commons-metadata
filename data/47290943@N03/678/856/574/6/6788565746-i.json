Meath.\n\nWe asked to know more about this interesting house, and we certainly got exactly what we asked for...\n\nOur excellent <b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/swordscookie/\" target=\"_blank\">swordscookie</a></b> did a Google search and found this account in a book about the Bomford family estates:\n&quot;<i>A farcical error took place about the middle of the 1800s concerning two little houses on the Drumlargan road belonging to Lord Langford. Lord Langford of Summerhill designed a straight avenue to run one mile from Lynch\u2019s Knock beside his house onto the road at Drumlargan. An architect was asked to design two gate-lodges to be placed at the end of the avenue on either side of the main road; the same architect also had to design two block-houses for the Indian Army to be sited to guard the Khyber Pass leading into Afghanistan. Needless to say the plans got mixed up and two low square block- houses with roofs like balloon-shaped pyramids were built on the road at Drumlargan. It would be interesting to know what the Indian Army thought about their blockhouses, but the Irish were intrigued with their \u201cBalloon Houses\u201d as they were soon named, and they remained an outstanding piece of local architecture until they were unjustifiably pulled down quite recently.</i>&quot;\n\nGreat information in from <b>Geri 65</b> who has a lovely family connection with this fantastic house:\n&quot;<i>My grand parents lived in balloon house, summerhill. My mum and her brothers and sisters all lived in this house. My mum spoke about balloon house with fond memories. My mum was born 1923 and am certain she was born in this house. I have a copy of my grandmothers will regarding the sale of balloon house. My mum passed away 6 years ago and I know she would be over the moon that people have took an interest in this beautiful house which she lived in and grew up in. Hope this has helped.</i>&quot;\n\nAnd we're delighted that <b>Geri 65</b> came back with some extra stories about her Mum, who would have been around 14 when this photo was taken, and about the Reilly family's life at the Balloon House in Drumlargan:\n&quot;<i>Hello Everyone. Thank you all for taken an interest in Balloon House. I do not have a great deal of info to tell you sadly. As my mum and her brothers and sisters have passed away. My grandparents name was a good Irish name. The Reilly Family. There where 6 children in the family. So 8 people lived in this lovely house. The house i believe was very basic inside and not very big at all. But as in all old Irish homes, my mum mentioned a huge fireplace with a wonderful fire burning. Keepin the house warm and there was always pots boiling on it. Even through the summer months. My grandparents had a small farm on the land around the house. I noticed in the photo , what I think is a old bike against the side wall. (well it looks like a bike). I can remember my mum mentioning the bike. Which was used as there form of transport. If this picture was taken in 1937, then my mum would have been 14 years old and working for a family, who she called &quot;Gentry&quot;. I think it was an English family who had a stud farm for horses. I wonder if this bike,is the one my mum used to get to work. Ha ha. Lovely thought. I know the house was built on a main road because I can remember my mum telling me that nobody could pass the house without my granny knowing about it. That always made me smile. I will dig out the Will of my grandmother and try find out more. May take some time, as my loft is full. What I do know is that mum loved Balloon House and she would be delighted for your interest. Thank you all for making me smile. Just to let you know, so glad I found this site. Hopefully soon I will have some more info. God Bless x</i>&quot;\n\nDate: 1937\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000303354\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ODEA 3/29</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "8515", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1937-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376316314", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1330340157"}, "originalsecret": "36fb6cc07d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7177", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6788565746/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
