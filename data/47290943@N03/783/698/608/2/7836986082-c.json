IMHO a broadside was a line of guns along the flank of the ship on one or more levels and capable of firing only on that side.  The Melampus was fitted with two quick firing 6 inchers in turrests but had several guns of similar and smaller sizes fitted along the sides therefore her main armament were broadside only.  The US ships in the website on Scad\u00e1n Dearg's comment could turn their turrets to fire broadside but by my understanding were moving to fire broadside rather than having their main armament on the broadside.\nSee the diagramme attached by Niall McAuley here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apollo_class_cruiser_diagrams_Brasseys_1897.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apollo_class_cruiser_diagrams_...</a>", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-7836986082-72157631205522930", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7836986082/#comment72157631205923618", "realname": "Miche\u00e1l Cattigan", "path_alias": null, "author": "80413507@N08", "iconserver": "5460", "datecreate": "1345722104", "_content": "Fair enough although i think we are splitting hairs.\n&quot;A broadside&quot; is a term that was used for firing all available guns at the same time from the side of a ship (as opposed to firing at will).
