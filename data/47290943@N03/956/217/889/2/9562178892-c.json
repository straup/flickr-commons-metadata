It was overtaken by state-directed initiatives by Germany, Britain and France. But at the time it was deemed a heroic success despite chaotic errors and the heavy loss of life, and the story of Emin Pasha\u2019s \u2018rescue\u2019 attracted huge publicity in Europe and America.  Initially this was entirely thanks to Stanley and his best-seller Into darkest Africa in 1890, but Parke gained celebrity when his journal (My personal experiences of Equatorial Africa) was published in 1891, followed by his more prosaic Guide to health in Africa in 1893.  His journal, while echoing much of the Social Darwinism of the time, is often more precise in detail than Stanley\u2019s account and documents the close human bond that Parke had built up with a Pygmy woman of the forest. However we now know that both these works were drafted and edited by his Dublin friend and former tutor John Knott.\nParke died suddenly in 1893, possibly a result of the lingering effects of his travels.  A statue was erected three years later outside the Natural History Museum to honour his exploits and his medical prowess.  His expedition had helped settle the terms of the scramble for central Africa, and it may also have unintentionally spread a devastating cattle disease into the region.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.irelandempire.ie/schools/Africa/Africa_Conquest_Parke.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.irelandempire.ie/schools/Africa/Africa_Conquest_Parke...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9562178892-72157635170988236", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9562178892/#comment72157635164641155", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1377078527", "_content": "His book &quot;My personal experiences of equatorial Africa&quot; is online here......\n\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/mypersonalexperi00park#page/n7/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/mypersonalexperi00park#page/n7/mod...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9562178892-72157635164641155", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9562178892/#comment72157635171666832", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1377082730", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Ah, his Monbuttu!

Since we left the great forest she has had several severe attacks, but struggled along in spite of increasing weakness, and would persist in accompanying our caravan. In common with all the other pigmies who followed us into the open plains, she suffered greatly from the direct rays of the sun, although she had the exclusive use of an umbrella which I made for her. I also gave her the pair of searlet breeches which Mr. Stanley had kindly given to me; these she managed to cover her head with, by passing her arms through the legs -- in which arrangement, of course, the then upper portion of the inverted garment was easily made to accommodate itself to her head. Like all natives, when at all ill, she lies on the ground, thinks she is going to die, and will make no effort to get along. Most of the pigmies who left their homes in the dense shally forest, and accompanied us and to the open plains, haye now pined away. I leave my poor little Monbuttu woman here with friendly natives, as she is unable to accompany us any further, and we have no carriers. She is a very great loss to me indeed; while she was able to do it she always carried my food. She was a universal favourite in the caravan, and our parting with her was a very pathetie one. I had good reason, indeed, to be grateful to her for the past. I have to thank her for the comparatively good health which I enjoyed in the forest, especially during the starvation period; when she collected for me the roots, leaves, fungi, insects, &amp;c., &amp;c., which were good to eat, and which were, of course, known only to the natives. I might have starved, or might have been poisoned, had it not been for her ministering care. She was always devoted and faithful to me, and, unlike some other ladies of the Dark Continent, her morals were entirely above suspicion. Her parting was singularly affecting and grateful, and her loss really cast a gloom over the caravan, as she was such a general favourite, always cheery and obliging. Although her scanty costume only consisted of Mr. Stanley's scarlet breeches, an umbrella, and a vine tied aronnd her waist as a belt -- from which nothing was suspended; yet this little dwarf always maintained all exalted dignity and superior position amongst the other women of the carravan, and never once have I known her to be a trouble to any one. She nursed me through many and many a fever with characteristic gentleness and modesty, and her last act at parting was to give me the ivory bangles which she wore in the forest, but which had now dropped from her attenuated arms and ankles. \nVide Nos. 20 and 23 on page 500. \n\n<a href=\"http://web.cc.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/~kitanisi/pygmy_doc/book/Parke91.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">web.cc.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/~kitanisi/pygmy_doc/book/Parke91...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9562178892-72157635175275996", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9562178892/#comment72157635169130819", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1377102442", "_content": "It is interesting to note Stanley's initial reaction to Parke, 'an extremely handsome young gentleman, diffident somewhat, but very prepossessing.'

Parke was entertained to a banquet by his brother officers of the Army Medical Staff. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland gave him an honorary fellowship, and at a banquet in Dublin, welcomed him to a company whose roll included the names of Joseph Lister, Louis Pasteur and James Paget. On 6th June 1890, the editorial staff of the Lancet entertained him in their office and presented him with a silver salver. That evening a banquet was given in his honour under the presidency of Sir Andrew Clark, P.R.C.P., and the principal speakers were Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and Sir James Paget. The British Medical Association awarded him its gold medal at Birmingham, and Durham University conferred on him its Doctorate of Common Laws. He also received high Egyptian decorations, and was the recipient of gold medals and honorary fellowships from many geographical societies.\n\nIn contrast to all this, the Government proved rather niggardly, and the only official recognition Parke received was permission to count his time with the expedition for full-paid service. Stanley called attention to this lapse in the strongest terms, in his preface to Parke's useful little book Guide to Health in Africa which was produced in 1893. In addition, in 1891, Parke published a large volume My personal experiences in Equatorial Africa, which was based on his diaries of the expedition. This provides a useful commentary and counterpoint on Stanley's much better-known account. After his return, Parke was appointed Surgeon-Captain to the 2nd Life Guards in London, and later was employed at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. He was gazetted Surgeon-Major on 5th February 1893. Within a year of his return to England he began to suffer attacks of Grand Mal. In the light of hindsight it is probable that these were due to cerebral infestation with cysticercosis cellulosae, the intermediate stage of the pork tapeworm, taenia solium, which afflicted so many members of the expedition. There is a family tradition that at this time Parke was engaged to the daughter of a Scottish peer and it was while on a visit to the Duke and Duchess of  St. Albans at Alt-na-Craig in Argyllshire, that he died suddenly on 10th September 1893 at the age of thirty-six.\n\nHis remains were returned to Ireland and interred in the family burial ground at Kilmessan in Co. Leitrim. A public subscription was raised in Ireland, and a bronze statue of him was erected in the grounds of the Natural History Museum, in Merrion Square, Dublin. His brother officers put up a memorial brass in the garrison chapel at Netley, and a Parke Memorial Hall, which contained a portrait of Parke, was built in Carrick-on-Shannon; this hall unfortunately was burnt down in 1922, during the 'troubles.'\n\nIn a letter to the Lancet of 23rd September 1893, Stanley wrote a final valediction to his friend. Coming from a man of his iron-hard character, it was an extraordinary tribute and fitting epitaph ' . . . true to the core, a very honest and punctiliously honourable gentleman; one made up of sweet simplicity, tendemess and loving sympathy.' \n\n<a href=\"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1033553/pdf/medhist00152-0029.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">europepmc.org/articles/PMC1033553/pdf/medhist00152-0029.pdf</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9562178892-72157635169447841", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9562178892/#comment72157635176263848", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1377106120", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/91549360@N03] Very underwhelming, I'm afraid - just a snippet under Miscellaneous notices:\n\n<blockquote>The execution of the statue of Surgeon-Major Parke, to be erected in this city, has been entrusted to Mr. Percy Wood, who has just completed the model.
