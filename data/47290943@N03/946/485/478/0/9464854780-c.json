This line served the Gortin and Creggan Limestone quarries which was about 1 mile in distance from the harbour. When the line was built it was single track with two passing loops, the first method of operation was using a Drum engine with a cable, and this was operated by one man and was located up at the head of the incline. A set of wagons , around three or four were attached to the cable at the quarry end, an equal number of MT wagons were attached to the continuous rope at the harbour end and the loaded wagons were set under controlled gravity descent, controlled by a man who operated a band brake to control the speed of the drum, as the laden wagons descended they hauled up the MT rake attached to the rope, the wagons be it full or MT were attached using a sprag, so that each wagon was clipped to the rope, the loops were arranged so that both sets of wagons passed each other on that section, as said the line was single track. When the MT wagons reached the quarry, then the full wagons had reached the harbour, both were un-clipped from the rope and either horse or hand propelling then took place at each end to position the wagons as required be it to load or unload, depending where each set was. \nAt busy times four sets of wagons could use the incline at the same time, as the first set of full wagons approached the first passing loop then a set of MT wagons started up from the harbour, they passed each other at the second loop, by then another set of fully loaded wagons was set down from the quarry and passed the first rake of MT wagons at the first loop going down from the quarry, by then another set of MT wagons had been clipped on at the harbour and again these passed each other at the second loop. This kind of operation required great skill by the men working the engine and by those whose job it was to attach or detach the wagons, to aid this a signalling system was erected using wooden posts with arms, just like on a main line, these signals were positioned at each loop and were hand operated, the engine driver at the head of the incline made the nessercerry adjustments to the speed of the wagons based on the signals he could see from the top of the incline, he had to have a clear sight to be able to see the signals, hence this method was only used in good clear conditions. \nIn 1910 the incline was modernised by doing away with the drum engine and installing a large stationary steam engine built by Alexander Chaplin and Co of Glasgow, this resembled a ships engine house, the engine was designed for use inside a mine where coal was to be pulled up an incline from under the bed of the sea, it is thought the engine was second hand and was re-built by the makers to suit the operations at Carnlough. This engine was sited at about the mid way point on the incline, roughly where the lime kilns were situated, as the boiler house there was used with the chimney from same as a double for the stationary engine, in other words the boiler that supplied the kilns also supplied steam for the haulage engine. Return wheels for the rope were provided at both ends of the line, so that the rope used was still in continuous motion, this improved system, allowed MT wagons to be taken to the quarry without the need to have full ones to counter balance the system. Instead of lowering three or four wagons down , the engine could handle 10 laded wagons from the quarry to the harbour, in 1954 this incline engine was electrified from the national grid, then serving Northern Ireland, the incline and railway continued in operation until around 1977.\nHarbour operations.\nAt the harbour the wagons were moved either by hand or horse, by 1940 a farm tractor was in use to move the wagons, turntables were used to turn each wagon and iron chutes were used to load coastal shipping, most of the limestone went to Scotland for use in the iron and steel making process, Scotland being limestone deficient, made Co Antrim the ideal choice for the vital product they required to make iron and steel, the limestone is used as a flux in the process, which it still is to this day. \nSecond Railway.\nIn 1896 a 3ft-6in gauge line was built from the harbour to tap into another area of pure limestone known as the Tullyoughter Quarry. This was first operated using a VB loco built by Dewinton of Carnarvon in North Wales, the loco  here was advertised for sale in the year 1900, probably upon receipt of the loco named OTTER. This first loco operated both the harbour lines of 4ft-8&amp;1/2 in and the 3ft-6in gauge Tullyoughter line, it being said in the advert that the loco was easily convertible from one gauge to another. This is believed to be the same loco operated by the contractor Kennedy, used in the Isle of Man re Peel Harbour construction and on the building of the Lochearnhead Railway in Perthshire, Scotland. \nThe loco named OTTER was built by Andrew Barclay No 770 built 1896. This loco was not delivered until 1898 and was purchased through the firm of Hurst Nelson , the latter supplied the wagons for use on the Tullyoughter line about 36 in all. The loco was originally built for stationary use to power an incline for a contractor, it was sent back to the makers and re-built as a locomotive and Hurst Nelson then bought it and supplied same to the Carnlough Limestone Co. It remained on the Tullyoughter line from 1898 until 1922, the quarry was by then worked out and the 2 mile line was lifted in 1924, the OTTER continued in use around the harbour and operated over the 3ft-6in section of track between the later and the whiting mill, a job previously done using horse traction, the loco was taken out of service in 1930 as the firebox was by then worn out, the loco remained on site until cut up for scrap in July 1951.\nVarious photos have appeared of the OTTER, the more common views are those by Robert French, who was one of the Lawrence photographers, the Lawrence photo business folded in 1913 and the views we see of the loco on the bridge at Carnlough were probably taken around 1900 to 1902. One or two other views have surfaced over the years with the loco in use and not actually posed for any one photographer.\nA similar loco to OTTER is in preservation at the SRPS in Scotland, the loco being No 840 built 1899 and of 3ft gauge, this loco is in full working order and one day it might go to Co Donegal for use on the Fintown Railway, only time will tell on the later.  \nThe first company named as used under the Carnlough banner was Carnlough Lime Co Ltd, changed to Carnlough Limestone Quarries Co Ltd in 1948 and then acquired by the Eglinton Limestone Co in 1970. \nAJW 9-8-2013.&quot;", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "id": "47267889-9464854780-72157635000228875", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9464854780/#comment72157635003552437", "realname": "Ben Fagan", "path_alias": null, "author": "99002941@N08", "iconserver": "5550", "datecreate": "1376125371", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackpoolbeach] Very interesting.

You are correct about the upper section being gravity worked, this was in fact the seperate Creggan Incline. At the head of the main incline a cut off line went to the right to connect with the Creggan gravity worked incline, this used a seperate electric winch to pull up the MT wagons, but the loaded ones were let down using the brakes on same as the winch could not take more than one wagon per trip, only wagons going up the incline needed the winch wire.", "authorname": "andrew.irishrail", "id": "47267889-9464854780-72157635017648152", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9464854780/#comment72157635018824991", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1376222161", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackpoolbeach] Thanks very much, Old Pete, for emailing Mr Waldron.
