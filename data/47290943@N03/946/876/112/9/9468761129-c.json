The sense of hurt Londonderry felt at this, and of accusations that he had misled Baldwin about the strength Nazi Germany's air force, led him to seek to clear his reputation as a 'warmonger' by engaging in amateur diplomacy. This involved visits to senior Nazis in Germany, and briefings with government officials in London. His high profile promotion of 'Anglo-German' friendship, in the end, marked him with a far greater slur than that which had led him to engage in appeasement in the first place. After playing a marginal role in the overthrow of Neville Chamberlain in 1940, he failed to win any favour from his cousin, Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Without office he produced his memoirs, Wings of Destiny (1943), a relatively short book that was considerably censored by his former colleagues.\n\n<a href=\"http://state.chemistrydaily.com/chemistry/Charles_Vane-Tempest-Stewart,_7th_Marquess_of_Londonderry\" rel=\"nofollow\">state.chemistrydaily.com/chemistry/Charles_Vane-Tempest-S...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9468761129-72157634996381378", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9468761129/#comment72157634990042243", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1376036219", "_content": "Lord Londonderry also had an illegitimate daughter with actress Fannie Ward, named Doroth\u00e9 Mabel Lewis.
