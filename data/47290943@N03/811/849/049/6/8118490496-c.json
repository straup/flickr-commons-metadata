This ID is then further confirmed by the Leslie tartan trews of the man on the left.  The soldier in the slouch hat is also wearing riding breeches, which seen together indicate that he is a member of the battalion's mounted infantry section, a particularly topical specialisation of that period.\n\nThe 'odd man out', is the soldier second from left who is wearing a field service cap (FSC) that was introduced in 1874 and then gradually phased out from around 1902.  His badge (just visible), appears to be a grenade shape (with possibly a coronet over).\n\nBecause of the uniforms and the slouch hat (introduced for foreign service in 1902, but also worn at home in the field on manoeuvres) I would date the photo to between 1901-03.\n\nIn 1902 the 1st Battalion KOSB were based in Belfast (Holywood Barracks), as part of the&quot;Belfast District&quot; within the British Army's nationwide garrisons.  The 1st Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers were also based in Belfast at that time and it seems likely to be the unit of the soldier in the 'odd man out' uniform.\n\nIt had long been the tradition that every summer the battalions went on annual training camp 'under canvas' (i.e. tented), where they practised musketry (rifle firing) for annual classification, and tactical manoeuvres.  The camp would usually conclude with a Brigade Exercise or Scheme, when all the battalions would come together for a combined manoeuvre.  That is very likely what is seen in this photo, where a small group of soldiers are carrying out &quot;cookhouse fatigues&quot; and specifically &quot;spud bashing&quot; (potato peeling).  To bear this out, two of the men are wearing fatigue jackets designed for dirty work.  \n\nAll the other photos in the series show the tented camp as was typically laid out and known as 'Lines', of which there were 3 types, company, or troop/squadron lines, gun, or transport lines, and horse lines.  The terminology used depended of course on whether they were artillery, cavalry, or infantry lines.", "authorname": "bobgbennett", "id": "47267889-8118490496-72157632210977045", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8118490496/#comment72157632215189692", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1355145668", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/66941036@N05] I don't know what's going on lately, but you people are on fire with the mystery solving!
