I wondered if there might be a connection between your photograph and Joseph Cordner as early aviation pioneers tended to have a mechanical background, e.g.. engineering, cycle or motor mechanic and such like. To the best of my knowledge the surname Cordner is unusual so there may well be a connection. Further research needed.
