It is one of the oldest electric railways in the world and was may be the first operating over a significant long distance of 9\u00bc miles. The power was generated by water turbines at Walkmill Falls, Bushmills and was fed by third rail to the train. The voltage was initially 290 V to 360 V, later reduced to 250 V after an accident killing a cyclist who came in contact with the third rail. In Summer 1899 operation was changed to overhead electric wire. \n\nThe postcard pictures must be taken between the opening in 1887 and summer 1899 since the third rail is visible behind the train.\n\nMore info see <a href=\"Giant's Causeway Tramway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>", "authorname": "PeetThePhotographer", "id": "47267889-5730438737-72157626867116488", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5730438737/#comment72157626867391158", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1307014147", "_content": "Thanks Peter!
