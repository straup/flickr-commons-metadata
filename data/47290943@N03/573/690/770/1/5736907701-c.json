The photo can be dated to pre 3/12/1922 as it appeared in a period newspaper of  the day, on that date.  Over fifty of the original open top armoured lancia cars were converted at the works but only seven were converted to rail cars and only two of them had turretts.   The road going version of the inchicore converted lancias served with the irish army ontill ww11 and were known as the &quot;hooded terrors&quot;.
