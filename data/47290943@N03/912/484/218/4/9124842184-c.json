In his youth, he was a popular figure in the court of Queen Victoria, and became well known to the public after publishing a best-selling account of his travels in the North Atlantic.\n\nHe is now best known as one of the most successful diplomats of his time. His long career in public service began as a commissioner to Syria in 1860, where his skillful diplomacy maintained British interests while preventing France from instituting a client state in Lebanon. After his success in Syria, Lord Dufferin served in the Government of the United Kingdom as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Under-Secretary of State for War. In 1872 he became the third Governor General of Canada, bolstering imperial ties in the early years of the Dominion, and in 1884 he reached the pinnacle of his diplomatic career as eighth Viceroy of India.\n\nThe Frederick W. Pomeroy &quot;Dufferin&quot; is not unfamiliar to Ontario residents, for scarcely a major city or town in the Canadian province does not have either a &quot;Dufferin Street&quot; or &quot;Dufferin Avenue,&quot; owing to his having served as Governor-General of Canada from 1872 to 1878. That his statue is guarded, so to speak, by a turbaned Indian as well as a Canadian voyageur reminds us that he also served the British crown as Viceroy of India (1884). Frederick Temple Hamilton, First Marquis of Dufferin and Ava (1826-1902), was not in fact a native of Belfast, having been born in Florence. He succeeded his father as the fifth baron Dufferin in 1841, was educated at Eton and Oxford, and from 1860 served the British government in various capacities, including under-secretary for India (1864-66) and secretary of war (1866), and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1868-72).", "authorname": "billh35", "id": "47267889-9124842184-72157634300144292", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9124842184/#comment72157634295147559", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1372062701", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/shanekillen] Thanks!
