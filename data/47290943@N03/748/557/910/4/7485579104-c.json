Men in particular may not have been so quick to show anti-treaty sympathies in Dublin during this time\n* The leading/prominent women (up front) don't seem to be notables in the WPDL. If this was Dublin, one might've expected Gonne or McSwiney or similar to be photographed in such a vigil.\n\nThese are all small points, but they add up (in my gut/head) to suggest it's not Dublin.\n\nAs an FYI, compare <a href=\"http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/HU015786/women-hunger-strikers-at-mountjoy-prison-dublin\" rel=\"nofollow\">this photo for instance</a>. Here we see Maud Gonne (no intro neccesary I hope), M. Barry Delaney (coeditor of L\u2019Irlande Libre with Gonne), and Annie McSwiney (the woman in front of the &quot;holy picture&quot;). Annie McSwiney was sister to Mary and Terence McSwiney. When this photo was taken, Terence was dead two years (from hunger strike), Mary was intered in Mountjoy (and was on hunger strike inside), and Annie was on a protest fast outside the gates. \n\nHunger strikes were one of the tools employed (often by women) to obtain publicity and put pressure on the Free State Government to release and/or improve conditions for anti-treaty prisoners. Because of the issue and the nature of the strikes, they tended to draw support from womens and religious groups.
