His father Patrick Nowlan an early member of the IRB and friend of James Stephens, was a cooper from Kilkenny city and who more than likely moved to work at Cassidy's whiskey monasterevin. A member of the Gaelic League, he was a lifelong supporter of the Irish language revival movement and a supporter of Sinn F\u00e9in from its foundation in 1905. In 1898 he was elected an alderman of Kilkenny Corporation, and used his time in the position to help promote the GAA, which having been set up 14 years prior was a relatively new organisation at the time.  In 1900 he became the first chairman of the Leinster Council of the GAA.  He was elected President of the national GAA at the 1901 Congress held in September of that year.
