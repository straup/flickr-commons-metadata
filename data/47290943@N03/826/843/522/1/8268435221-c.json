They were numbered from 1 to 6, and just one of these, number 6, lasted until the close of the tramway in 1932, having been completely rebuilt at the Midland Great Western Railway works at Broadstone in 1914. These locomotives were known informally as the 'kettles'. They were never a great success, as they were rather underpowered for the job in hand.....\n....In 1896 came number 8, an 0-4-2 tank also built by Thos. Green &amp; Son, and smaller than number 7. It was rebuilt as a 2-4-2T in 1903, to become similar to number 9. Number 9 arrived in 1899, a 2-4-2T built by the Brush Engineering Works, Loughborough. <b>The last new locomotive to arrive was built by Thos. Green &amp; Son in 1906, also similar to number 9, and received number 2 in replacement for the original number 2 which was withdrawn and scrapped.</b> It was renumbered as number 10 in 1915, and both numbers 9 and 10 were the only other locomotives to last to the end in 1932.</i>\n\nThis being the new engine number 2, it dates the photo between 1906 and 1915.", "authorname": "eyelightfilms", "id": "47267889-8268435221-72157632233796661", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8268435221/#comment72157632233804051", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1355392718", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/8468254@N02] I'm getting Woreen &amp; Son, however unlikely that might sound and &quot;Leeds &amp; London, Makers 1906, No. 367&quot;.", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8268435221-72157632233804051", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8268435221/#comment72157632233824581", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1355393036", "_content": "Well a search for &quot;locomotive no 367 ireland 2-4-2 dublin and blessington&quot; doesn't produce anything sensible.", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8268435221-72157632233824581", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8268435221/#comment72157632233826803", "realname": "", "path_alias": "alimarante", "author": "41675580@N08", "iconserver": "6105", "datecreate": "1355393071", "_content": "A &quot;Push Me Pull Me&quot; Puffer!", "authorname": "FrigateRN", "id": "47267889-8268435221-72157632233826803", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8268435221/#comment72157632238036938", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1355393108", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Looks more like worker to me after a bit of PSPing.
