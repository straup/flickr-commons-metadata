They took over from William Pringle, corn merchants.  As the image shows them at 16, the image must be later or equal to 1865.  \n\nTo the far right of the image, can been seen No 24  with J Spence name above the door and the words SADDLES AND COLLAR MAKER.  Joseph Spence was a saddler who was at no 24 for many years.\n\nAlso on the far right can be seen letters &quot;Wm HAD&quot; this refers to William Haddow of the Clydesdale Inn, no 26. He owned it from about 1860 to 1866/67.  Gavin Halliday took over from 1866/67 to 1869/70.  Halliday did not remove the HADDOW sign but put a new sign up above the HADDOW but in the centre of the building with his name on it.  William Caldwell took over in 1870/71.  He did replace the HADDOW sign with Wm CALDWELL.\n\nRobert Dickson Refreshment Rooms, N.B.R.  (northern section) North British Railway appeared in 1866-67. First mention at 10 Grassmarket is 1867-68.\n\nHence the image must be around 1867-70.\n\nIn 1867-68 Grassmarket:\n\n26 Gavin Halliday, Clydesdale Inn\n26 John Howison\n26 Wni Gillies\n24 Joseph Spence, Saddler\n22 Mrs Williamson, Tobacconist\n18 and 20 Gladstone Close, Alex Brownlee.Stabler - house 20\n16 Mossman and Watson, Ham Curers and Provision Merchants\n14 Brown's Close, Mrs Barclay\n12 and 14 John Thomas Ireland, Black Bull \n10 Robert Dickson, Refreshment rooms\n8 Crawford's Close, P Groan. Spirit Dealer\n6 J Lister, victual dealer \u2014 house. 36\n4 Adam Wilson, horse dealer\n2 Alexander Anderson,  confectioner\n\nThe first mention of the Beehive inn was in 1868 when Brownlee was registered as Beehive Inn (but he still had the stabling business at 20).  Today there is  a stone plaque on the building bearing the date 1868.  It has been wrongly assumed, on the Grassmarket web site and comments on this image,  that this is the date the present building was built but I believe this is the date it was designed.  I'm looking at another image where no 18 to 22  is the same as the above image but the Former Soldiers' Married Quarters.(1873) can be seen in the background. Hence the present Beehive building wasn't built until after 1873.\n\nIn the above image the Gladstone Close sign is seen as the 20 between the words Gladstone and Close.  In later images the words Gladstone Close are joined together in a semi-circle with 20 in the centre.  I can see another  image where Halliday has taken over the Clydesdale Inn but the Gladstone Close sign has the old version.
