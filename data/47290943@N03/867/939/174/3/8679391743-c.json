On these dates the statue was painted white, the figure adorned with a yellow cloak, the horse garlanded with orange lilies and ribbons, and the surrounding railings painted orange and blue. Placing shamrock and green and white ribbons (the national colours) under the horse\u2019s uplifted foot was even more provocative to the nationalists, who retaliated with stone throwing and rioting. In 1710 the statue was smeared with mud and its sceptre stolen by several students from nearby Trinity College, more of whom were expelled. It was smeared with tar several times, and watchmen had to be posted at the statue to protect it. It was finally taken after it was badly damaged in an explosion in November 1928.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8679391743-72157633332445997", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8679391743/#comment72157633332456621", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1366876812", "_content": "<a href=\"http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,715799,734088,7,9\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,715799,734088,7,9</a>", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8679391743-72157633332456621", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8679391743/#comment72157633332458211", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1366876840", "_content": "&quot;Equestrian Statue of William III&quot;, it says.", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8679391743-72157633332458211", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8679391743/#comment72157633348065058", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1366876889", "_content": "<a href=\"http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,715799,734088,7,7\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,715799,734088,7,7</a> says &quot;Statue of King Wm III&quot;", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8679391743-72157633348065058", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8679391743/#comment72157633332467313", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1366876992", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] They're brilliant!

However, in 1696/97 he did acquire a horse, White Sorrel (sometimes Sorel), that became his favourite mount. The horse was bred at Wallington Hall, here in Northumberland, and had been owned by Sir John Fenwick, who as early as 1689 was implicated in plots against King William. Arrested and arraigned, he was imprisoned in Newgate and, refusing to name other conspirators, was subjected to bills of attainder. The law that demanded the evidence of two witnesses in cases of treason was set aside so no jury was assembled and the estates and possessions of the accused were forfeit to the Crown. \u2018The Whigs, the great forensic defenders of liberty and of the purity of justice, condemned this man by a law made on purpose to stain the scaffold with his blood\u2019 (Burnet\u2019s History of Reform). Sir John was executed on Tower Hill on 28 January 1697. His horse became the property of the king . . . and posthumously avenged his first owner. Roger Coke mentions \u2018the abominable Jacobite poem upon Sorel, beginning \u201cIllustrious sonipes &amp; c\u201d by which they meant the horse that threw his Majesty at Hampton Court: and their ridiculous health \u201cTo the little gentleman in the black velvet coat\u201d by which they meant the mole that made the hole into which Sorel\u2019s foot slipt\u2019. Wallington Hall, incidentally, casts its shadow over Irish affairs later on. It was the family home of Sir Charles Trevelyan, Famine overseer.\n\n\u2014Yours etc.,\nAINE MARIE CHADWICK\nNorthumberland", "authorname": "Inverarra", "id": "47267889-8679391743-72157633332933139", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8679391743/#comment72157633348553404", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "20727502@N00", "iconserver": "7070", "datecreate": "1366884939", "_content": "Here's <a href=\"http://img.inkfrog.com/click_enlarge1.php?image=74_006.jpg&amp;username=pasttimepostcards&amp;aid=149233822\" rel=\"nofollow\">an interesting postcard</a> from 1905.
