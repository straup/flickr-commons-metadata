Lord Palmerston has given directions to restore it as much as possible, and his agent here is strictly carrying out his lordship's wishes. Several old houses, obstructing the view of this fine old building, have been thrown down, and it is now enclosed by a large wall, surmounted with an iron paling, admitting a perfect view of the edifice. The ground immediately inside this wall has been planted, and every exertion is being made to make the &quot;Sligo Abbey&quot; as interesting as possible to the townspeople.</i></blockquote>\nThe stone wall and the ion paling are visible in the top-right photo.\n\nThe Pall Mall Gazette, March 26, 1866\n<blockquote><i>The High Sheriff of the County of Sligo has offered \u00a3100 as a commencement of a subscription towards the renovation of Sligo Abbey, as a memorial of  Lord Palmerston, the deceased statesman having often himself , it is stated, expressed a wish to restore the edifice</i></blockquote>\n\nFreeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser (Dublin, Ireland), Monday, February 1, 1897 reporting on questions in parliament:\n<blockquote><i>In answer to Mr Collery\nMr Hanbury said - I have just received a telegram from the Board of Works on this subject. The Board understand that the order closing the old Sligo Abbey as a place of interment was issued early in 1895. The ruins, which are vested in the Board of Works, were repaired by the late Lord Mount Temple. Further work considered desirable has been postponed owing to the condition of the graveyard, but will be carried out gradually as the condition of the graveyard admits of it</i></blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-8671560382-72157633301968585", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8671560382/#comment72157633307782710", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1366668563", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Brilliant research, thanks!
