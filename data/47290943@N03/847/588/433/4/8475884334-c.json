Thompson, were met at the railway station by the Mayor (Mr. R. Power), the High Sheriff (Mr. M. McDonald), and members of the Corporation, and an address was presented welcoming the Lord Lieutenant on behalf of the citizens. In reply, Lord Aberdeen said the welcome extended to them was &quot;full of significance and most gratifying.&quot; He acknowledged the sympathy extended towards the Belgian refugees and towards the wounded from the scene of war.\n...\nAt the <b>City Hall</b>, an address from the Corporation to Lady Aberdeen was read ... On arrival at the Good Shepherd Convent their Excellencies were presented with an illuminated address, read by Nancy Lidwell ... The Right Rev.

Yes that is John Harrison holding the mace, sadly a couple of years after this photo was taken he lost his son in the war.\nFrom The Waterford News - 22th of September 1916.\n\n&quot;THE ROLL OF HONOUR. \n\nSeveral letters have been received in Waterford from soldiers at the front annoucing the death of Sergeant John Harrison, Leinster Regiment, son of Sergeant-at-Mace Harrison. Sergeant Harrison was quite a young man. He was in the South Irish Horse for some years, and during the special recruiting campaign in Waterford in March, 1915, he joined the cadet corps of the Leinster Regiment. He has been for some time at the front, and, although his death is not officially announced, there appears to be little doubt but that he has been killed, as the writer of one of the letters referred to stated that poor Jack Harrison was killed alongside of him, and that he only lived a short time after being struck. Amongst all who knew John Harrison he was very popular, and his death will be generally regretted. Deep sympathy will also be felt with his widow, father mother and other relatives in their bereavement.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/pages-in-history/newspaper-digitisation-pi/1916/county-waterford-officers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/page...</a>", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-8475884334-72157632770115651", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8475884334/#comment72157632775281424", "realname": "", "path_alias": "eyelightfilms", "author": "64555638@N00", "iconserver": "39", "datecreate": "1360949075", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/789920/HARRISON, JOHN F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sgt.
