This is one of the largest ports of call in the United Kingdom, and the great land-locked basin of Queenstown communicating with it could give shelter to the whole British fleet if needed. The vessels awaiting orders or wind-bound lie in the harbour or estuary of Queenstown, as do those discharging their cargoes into smaller vessels coming up to Cork at Passage West; these constitute by far the most important portion of the shipping here; but other vessels come up to Cork, and are moored alongside the quays. About 8,000 seamen coming from foreign ports alone enter this harbour under the British flag annually. These for the most part remain on board their ships during their stay at Queenstown, whilst awaiting &quot;orders&quot; as to the port to which to carry the cargoes, except in case of sickness, when they are sent on shore to the hospital. The boarding-houses for seamen are situated on the quays in various parishes, and are all kept by Roman Catholics, but Protestant inmates are occasionally visited by the parochial clergy. From the fact that so few seamen live out of their ships here, comparatively speaking there is less reason to provide for them spiritually than at other ports on shore; few attend divine service for the same reason, and these are chiefly captains, and fewer still communicate; but such seamen as do present themselves at church-doors are freely provided with seats. Spiritual work here is most needed afloat, and a chaplain who has been secured by the Missions to Seamen Society here for nearly twenty years, appointed by the rector of Queenstown, and serving as his curate afloat, is provided with a schooner yacht for the purpose of visiting the ships off Queenstown. There is also a Nonconformist scripture reader at work here; also a sailors' home at Cork, and another at Queenstown. The system of selling bibles and prayer-books at the conclusion of week-day services on board ships in outer roadsteads has been most successfully developed by the chaplain on the Cork River, whilst the cosmopolitan character of the mission afloat is aptly illustrated by the fact that during the past eighteen years 9,762 bibles, 6,315 testaments, and 2,335 prayer-books, were sold to seamen afloat by the chaplain in twenty-two different languages. The Italians bought the largest number, Norwegians, Germans, and Swedes being the next largest, and English seamen only the fifth largest purchasers, the Norwegians buying our prayer-book, translated into their own tongue, very largely. This roadstead chaplain has also been very successful in promoting temperance; 450 sailors signed the pledge in this harbour during [60/61] the two years ending March 1877. This is made a stepping-stone to religious conviction and devout living; such self-denial commonly leading to prayerful conduct and Christian practice.", "authorname": "mogey", "id": "47267889-8141082551-72157631901211426", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8141082551/#comment72157631902578246", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1351776508", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/66151649@N02] We have one of his <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000477217\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>books in our catalogue</b></a>, but I can't find any (digitised) photos of Peter Kerley.
