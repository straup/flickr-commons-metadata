There were 31 men and 43 women admitted during that period. The increase in the number under treatment involved an increase of nearly \u00a3600 in the expenses. The Doctor has to congratulate himself, however, on the Asylum's entire immunity from cases of suicide, serious accident, or epidemic. The mortality was much less than that of 1879. Games, plays, sea-side trips, and a library are the greatest aids to medical science in the treatment of the unfortunate insane; and those are used to the fullest measure and with the utmost liberality, under the kindly regime of Dr. Atkins and the Board of Governors, who have expressed their confidence in his conduct of the institution. The reports of Drs. Nugent and Hatchell are also favourable, and altogether we have never read a cheerier account of one of those places which, within the memory of the young amongst us, were looked upon as the joyless, hopeless prisons of a tortured chain-gang of lunatics, leading a life worse than the most painful death.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8147225780-72157631910633360", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8147225780/#comment72157631910683076", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1351852941", "_content": "The room has skylights and a fireplace (hence a chimney).", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-8147225780-72157631910683076", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8147225780/#comment72157631910707886", "realname": "", "path_alias": "crexcrex", "author": "59302818@N00", "iconserver": "2877", "datecreate": "1351853311", "_content": "It looks a tad upmarket for the interior of an institution in the Ireland of the 19th century.
