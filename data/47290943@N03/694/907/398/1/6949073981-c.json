Under severe rank and file pressure, the London-based National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) sanctioned a national strike in Ireland in December 1916. As private interests would not meet the pay demand, the government stepped in to keep the war effort running smoothly, took control of Ireland's thirty two railway companies, and awarded a substantial war bonus. Over the next nine months the NUR's Irish affiliation rocketed from 5,000 to 17,000 members.  It was a victory for the rank and file over the union\u2019s London executive, as well as for the union over the railway companies. In 1917 NUR men launched the monthly journal </i><b>New Way</b><i> and developed the most articulate rank and file movement in Ireland during these years. </i>\n\nThe same article mentions James 'Big Jim' Larkin (and his hat and droopy moustache), but according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Larkin\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Larkin</a> he was in the USA between 1914 and 1923.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-6949073981-72157629503548427", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6949073981/#comment72157629139065344", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1330799251", "_content": "British Library, Colindale Newspaper Library\n&quot;The New Way&quot; Dublin 1917, Irish Railway Review\nThe organ of railway workers and railway users in Ireland.\nMicrofilm: Oct.1917\n<a href=\"http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=0&amp;vl%2810130439UI0%29=any&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28NPL%29&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1330798984026&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Advanced&amp;vl%281UIStartWith1%29=contains&amp;indx=1&amp;tb=t&amp;vl%2841497491UI2%29=any&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=the+new+way&amp;fn=search&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;vl%28freeText2%29=&amp;frbg=&amp;ct=search&amp;vl%2810130438UI1%29=any&amp;vl%281UIStartWith2%29=contains&amp;dum=true&amp;vl%281UIStartWith0%29=exact&amp;vl%2846690061UI3%29=all_items&amp;Submit=Search&amp;vl%28freeText1%29=\" rel=\"nofollow\">explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt...</a>", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "id": "47267889-6949073981-72157629139065344", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6949073981/#comment72157629139076984", "realname": "", "path_alias": "johnspooner", "author": "29809546@N00", "iconserver": "8104", "datecreate": "1330799364", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rpsmithbarney/5841912039/\">An antique NUR lapel badge</a>, probably not that dissimilar to those worn by some of the men in the picture", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-6949073981-72157629139076984", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6949073981/#comment72157629147466520", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1330890536", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Great info on the NUR, thanks.
