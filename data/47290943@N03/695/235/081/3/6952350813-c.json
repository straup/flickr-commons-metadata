At one time when Anson and Verner were away on a trip, possibly to England, these two negroes, one tall like Anson and one low in stature like Verner, would put on the Englishmen's clothes, ride their top horses and go to town; passing themselves off as ['Mr.?] Anson and ['Mr.?] Verner.

This was about the size of Co. Waterford as in that climate with constant danger of droughts much more land was needed per beast than here. The nearest town was 23 miles away and there was no road. They had to drive in a buggy straight across the prairie. Their nearest neighbour was the post master who had a very long neck. He had been lynched for horse stealing and only just cut down in time by his friends. Although there were so few people the gossip was terrific. Everything that happened was known in the town and round about. Two elderly men who had a 60 year old housekeeper were told this was improper and one of them must marry her. They drew lots and the loser did it. Mother and an Irish maid who went out with her thought they would try to fill up holes in the ground near the ranch house with stones and the gossips said this was most unladylike.</i>\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.waterfordcountymuseum.org/exhibit/web/Display/article/167/2/?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ansons at Ardmore</a> by Clodagh Anson (daughter of the Hon Claude and Lady Codagh) on the Waterford County Museum website.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-6952350813-72157629512501867", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6952350813/#comment72157629147917572", "realname": "", "path_alias": "fotos_de_anemarie", "author": "38020241@N07", "iconserver": "3752", "datecreate": "1330894183", "_content": "Fotograficamente hablando,diria que es una fotografia de excelente factura-refleja la personalidad de este caballero...Por otro lado,rescato la nobleza rasgos que habla en si misma la imagen de discreta elegancia ... como siempre, memorias de un pasado no tan lejano.\nAnemarie", "authorname": "asixtoromero", "id": "47267889-6952350813-72157629147917572", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6952350813/#comment72157629148981100", "realname": "", "path_alias": "an_solas", "author": "31536722@N00", "iconserver": "4104", "datecreate": "1330903256", "_content": "That's a fantastic portrait, pin sharp and nicely lit.
