This is an extract from the clubs website.\n&quot;From its earliest days Waterford Athletic Club had its fair share of famous sports people as an examination of its first officers illustrates. The President was the famed G.A.A. referee Willie Walsh, one of the giants of the early years of that association. The vice President was Peter O'Connor, double Olympic medallist in the 1906 Games where he won gold in the triple jump with 14.08m and silver in the long jump with 7.02m. After his final attempt victory in the triple jump, O'Connor (who had been forced by political considerations to compete for Great Britain) climbed the flagpole, pulled down the Union Jack and replaced it with the green flag of Ireland.&quot;", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-6958455845-72157629160266130", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6958455845/#comment72157629527294611", "realname": "Paul O'Farrell", "path_alias": null, "author": "33577523@N08", "iconserver": "7438", "datecreate": "1331058457", "_content": "The shed in the background appears in some of Pooles other photos such as this one <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000032763/Image?lookfor=http://kildarest.nli.ie/npa/pi/pi272a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">POOLEIMP 272A</a>\nIt looks to me like it's probably taken in the peoples park by the Goff cycle track.

W. Clyne, J. Curry, Frank Furlong and others. I may indeed, gentlemen, attribute the greater portion of my success in the athletic arena to my having come to live in Waterford.  For years I have been hovering around record figures but bad luck haunted me.  My jumps were always a wee bit short of the mark and, when over the mark as they were on several occasions, the ground failed to stand the test of the spirit level, which is absolutely essential before any credence is given to any jumps. I would have disappeared and chucked athletics altogether, were it not for three reasons, viz., \n1st. The kindness of my employer, Mr. David Dunford, Solicitor, in permitting me to attend all the main athletic meetings in the South of Ireland, in a greater part of Leinster and elsewhere.\n2nd. I found splendid facilities in Waterford for training - Waterpark College grounds for the long jump and the Goff track for sprinting. This track is the finest track in Ireland for cycling and sprinting.\n3rd. I received every encouragement in the flattering and undeserved articles from the pen of my good and true friend, Mr. Redmond, in his excellent paper - the Waterford News.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://waterfordireland.tripod.com/peter_o'connor.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">waterfordireland.tripod.com/peter_o'connor.htm</a>", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-6958455845-72157629528364495", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6958455845/#comment72157629534968395", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1331150938", "_content": "Excellent piece Paul, It shows how the athlete benefitted from good will and good fortune.
