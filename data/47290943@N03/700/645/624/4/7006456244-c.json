Ltd at no. 41 was a large, curved pane of glass at the left corner of the entrance. However, the facade gives no indication of the work activity that took place in the building.\nOn the first floor was the general office; on the third floor was was a workshop where up to 10 women worked, mainly at sewing machines, making a wide range of surgical supports and corsets - all bespoke. On the top floor was a workroom where hypodermic syringes were sharpened and hypodermic needles were sharpened. \nTo the rear of the building, on similar floors, were workshops where artificial limbs, hand-made surgical footwear, steel spinal supports, crutches, various leg calipers, arch supports, hospital trolleys and furniture were made. Even by the late 1970s there was a fully-fledged forge in daily operation in the metal workshop - and this is just the tip of the iceberg of the activity that went on in this one premises on Grafton Street!
