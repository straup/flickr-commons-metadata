But here's a few lines on the cars:\n\nThe Free State Army's Armoured Car Corps was established in September, 1922. Officer commanding was Capt. Joe Hyland. (He may or may not be in the picture).\n\nThe corps had different armoured car types (including Lancia and Peerless cars), but the most notable was the Rolls-Royce. Nicknamed &quot;the Whippet&quot; in Ireland it was built on the &quot;Silver Ghost&quot; chassis, and had a turret mounted Vickers .303 water-cooled machine-gun. Although it's engine was liable to overheat unless the armoured radiator doors were left open, they were powerful and relatively quiet (important in the type of conflicts seen in the Civil War).\n\nIt was common to give nicknames to cars. They were: \nARR 1 'Tom Keogh' (renamed from 'Danny Boy' after Col.Comdt. Keogh was killed in 1922)\nARR 2 'Sliabh no mBan' \nARR 3 'Fighting Second' \nARR 4 'The Baby' \nARR 5 'The Manager'\nARR 6 'Custom House' \nARR 7 'Moneygall' \nARR 8 'The Big Fellow' \nARR 9 'Ex-Mutineer' \nARR 10 'Flying Fifty'\nARR 11 'Kilmichael'\nARR 12 'Knockananna'\nARR 14 'The High Chief'\n(Seemingly there was no ARR 13 for superstitious reasons)\n\nI couldn't find a summary of the history of ARR 8, but ARR 3 (on the right of the pic) took part in the fighting for Dublin in June/July of 1922 and was active from the very start of the Irish civil war. It was noted to be on patrol in the area of the Four courts in May 1922. The fighting 2nd went through the early months of the war with its original British Crown forces registration until it was appointed its ARR number in December 1922. \n\nAnti-treaty forces also had a few (improvised) armored cars. The 'Queen of the West' was constructed in Mayo and 'The River Lee' was constructed in Cork. \n\nFurther reading:\n* Details of ARR2: <a href=\"http://www.curragh.info/articles/silabhnamban.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.curragh.info/articles/silabhnamban.htm</a>\n* Peter Leslie, &quot;Armoured Cars in Ireland [Pt.1]&quot; Military Modelling (May 1980)\n* Duggan, John P.
