But he left no children. The title and estate therefore passed to his brother, William, who until then had lived at Macroom Castle, an inheritance from his great uncle, Robert Hedges-Eyre. By his wife (Jane Herbert of Muckross), William, 3rd Lord of Bantry, had five daughters and an only son who became the 4th and last Lord Bantry. On his death the title became extinct and the property passed through his eldest sister Elizabeth Leigh, who assumed the additional name White. Mr Leigh-White, who had married Arethusa Hawker, died in 1920 and was succeeded by his daughter, Clodagh now Mrs ShelswellWhite. The more recent history of Bantry House and its owners is so closely linked with the art treasures in the house that it is well to mention a few of the items included in Lord Bantry's collection. \nMost of the pieces he brought there are still at Bantry. Stephen Gwynne has said that they gain piquancy by contrast with the rugged beauty which surrounds the house and has referred to them as \u2018the Wallace Collection of Ireland.\u2019", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8764827950-72157633560147174", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8764827950/#comment72157633560422602", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1369127731", "_content": "I am not sure about these &quot;Improvements to Flickr&quot; It is more difficult to edit comments and it feels less intuitive and less user friendly", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8764827950-72157633560422602", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8764827950/#comment72157633560955134", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1369128592", "_content": "Lots of Archives on the house at UCC Library <a href=\"http://booleweb.ucc.ie/index.php?pageID=261\" rel=\"nofollow\">booleweb.ucc.ie/index.php?pageID=261</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8764827950-72157633560955134", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8764827950/#comment72157633561030326", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1369128715", "_content": "From the NUIG <a href=\"http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/property-show.jsp?id=3768\" rel=\"nofollow\">landed estates database:</a><i>Bantry House was held in fee by the Earl of Bantry at the time of Griffith's Valuation, when it was valued at \u00a3125.
