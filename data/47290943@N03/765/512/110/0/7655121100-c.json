By way of support, to the right and behind the photographer is (was) the biology building.  (I say &quot;was&quot; because that building was knocked-down in the early part of the 21st C. Some years after I left UCC myself).\n\nIt's also worth noting that behind the hedge (on front of the building with the chimneys on the right) is what is still called the &quot;president's garden&quot;. The president's office is in that building with the chimneys. The presidents garden is traditionally where staff, class and confering photos were taken. Like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/araireland/7125543835/\">this nice one from 1909</a>. These days the larger group photos get taken elsewhere.
