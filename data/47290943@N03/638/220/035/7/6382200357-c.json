In effect, the Great Northern Railway Board was a ntional industry run jointly by the Irish and Northern Ireland governments.\n\nIn 1956, the NI Govt under the auspices of the Minstry of Commerce announced that it intended  to close the sections of line within Northern Ireland of the Portadown-Clones-Cavan, Dundalk-Clones-Enniskillen-Omagh and Bundoran Jnc Bundoran lines. Under statutory requirements the respective ministries of commerce referred the proposals to the Transport Tribunals in Dublin and Belfast. The one in Dublin very firml;y opposed the closures saying that they would save only \u00a314,000. A further finding was that dieselisation would have turned the \u00a314,000 loss into a \u00a368,000 profit. The Northern Tribunal chairman rejected the southern board's findings, (the NI Govt offered no evidence) and voted to go ahead with closure anyway - which took effect from the end of September 1957.\n\nThis left the Bundoran branch as an unworkable 8 mile stretch in the Republic, a Dundalk to Clones railway, and a Glasslough-Clones-Cavan (and Belturbet Branch) railway. Cavan was served from Dublin via a branch from the Mullingar to Sligo railway. The Passenger traffic on offer on the remaining lines was insufficient to make them an economic condition, so the GNRB applied to close them - the necessary permission could not be obtained in time so there was a temporary service from Dundalk to Clones, Glasslough to Clones and Clones to Cavan, with a service on the Belturbet branch as well. This lasted until 12th October 1957 after which there was some parcel and freight traffic.\n\nI hope this is of interest. If you would like to know more there is a book by Edward M Patterson called &quot;The Great Northern Railway (Ireland), published by Oakwood Press (New Edition 2003 - 0 85361 602 7).\n\nThere are other useful books too, let me know if anyone would like details.\n\nBest wishes", "authorname": "Lindsey Axholme", "id": "47267889-6382200357-72157629290595613", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6382200357/#comment72157629301163367", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1329141466", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/53806340@N06] Thanks, Lindsey!
