This new role was emphasized in 1845 when a regulation was made under which new recruits were made to sign a written agreement to serve aboard ships of the Royal Navy if required to do so.\n \nIt was now becoming clear that the new organisation had been successful in its task of combating smuggling, and a report to the Treasury in 1839 stated that 'smuggling is in a declining state'.\n \nThe effectiveness of the Coast Guard as a naval reserve was put to the test during the Crimean War in 1854. In all, 3,000 Coast Guards served during that war, their places on the coast being taken by retired Pensioners.\n \nAt the end of that war in 1856, the Admiralty was criticised for it lack of preparedness in going to sea with crews who were not fully trained. The Admiralty's response to this was a proposal that the Coast Guard Service should be transferred completely to the Admiralty and trained as a reserve for the fleet. Accordingly, despite protests from the Board of Customs, the Coast Guard Service Act was passed in July 1856 to &quot;provide for the better defense of the coast of the Realm, and the more ready manning of the Navy&quot;. The Coast Guard was placed under Admiralty control on 1 October 1856. While the act laid down that the protection of the revenue remained the responsibilty of the Coast Guard, counter smuggling activities became only a minor part of the Coast Guard duties as a result of the transfer to the Admiralty. Although the act made no mention of life saving, duties laid down included assistance to vessels in danger, taking charge of wrecks, the operation of life saving apparatus, and an active participation in the lifeboats which had been stationed around the coasts.&quot;\n<a title=\"Coastguard_History\" href=\"#//yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Coastguard_History\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Coastguard History</b></a>", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-6388042307-72157631504354166", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6388042307"}}
