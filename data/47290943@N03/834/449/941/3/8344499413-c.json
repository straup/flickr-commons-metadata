The suspension bridge there now was put up in the 1980s or so.\n\nAlso, interesting to see how the train shed had been boarded up and the tracks leading to it taken up by 1967 - the train was intact well beyond Ballinhassig as late as 1965. As you can see here the track to the left was not touched - this went across the city to Glanmire Road. The colour photo above is a service en route to that station. This was done away with, as Flying Snail above comments, in 1976.\n\nIn 1965, some of the old name signs for stations west of Cork were discarded on the platforms near the train shed.
