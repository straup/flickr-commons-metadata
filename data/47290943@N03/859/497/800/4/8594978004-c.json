The Keep was refaced and equipped with streamlined modern battlements, and the adjoining dwelling house was rebuilt. A door in the Coach House bears his initials and the date 1874.Under his auspices, the Butlerstown branch of the Irish National League held meetings at the Castle. After his death in 1885 the Castle passed to his son Joseph Biggar, the noted antiquarian. Amongst the guests of the Biggars at the Castle were the Gillis's of Pau, France, and the great Tim Healy himself. By a strange twist of fortune, the tenant of the younger Biggar at Butlerstown at the close of the Century was T.R. Prendergast, whose wife was a great-great-granddaughter of the last Sherlock of Butlerstown. \n\nEarly in the present Century, the Castle was occupied by Harry Fisher , the Waterford newspaperman. The next landlords were the Nolan family of Kilronan, who installed as tenant an old lady named Hearne, who died at the age of 94, and later a family named O'Connor. Mike O'Connor was active in the Troubled Times, and in the War of Independence, frequently sheltered Volunteers in the Outhouses of the Castle. On one occassion a Volunteer named O'Rourke was wounded by the Black and Tans, who pursued him to the Butlerstown area. As the passed up and down the road searching for him, Mike O'Connor leaned against the gate, passing the time of day and making helpful suggestions. All the time he had O'Rourke hidden at the top of the Castle. During the Civil War, Butlerstown was occupied by a company of Republicans commanded by Tom Brennan of Tramore, several of the house in the area being held at this time ( 1920's ) to cover the retreat of the Republicans and delay the advance of the Free State Soldiers after the capture of Waterford. O'Connor's wife was ill at the time, and the besiegers allowed food to be hauled up in a basket to her at the top of the Castle. Eventually her condition became so critical that O\u2019Connor persuaded the garrison to surrender.", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8594978004-72157633098983269", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8594978004/#comment72157633103326524", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1364379671", "_content": "Doesn't sound like the sort of place to have that many servants.
