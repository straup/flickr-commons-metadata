It is Ballaghosheen or  the Pass of Oisin.  It is an alternative route to the Ring of Kerry from Killarney to Waterville which long predates the Ring in importance and features strongly in the tales of the Fianna.  The picture shows a man on his cart heading towards Killarney and inland in general. A warrior of the Fianna, coming in the opposite direction in long and swift strides from great feats in the land of Ireland, would view the sea here for the first time. The view of the sea is distant and constrained by the coastal mountains but after a long journey overland it is an inspiring vista.  Here Oisin stood and saw further than any had ever seen before - to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g surrounded by the foam of the Atlantic but within reach of his white steed. In that land of eternal youth he spent endless happy years, so please retain the meaning in the place name so that one day this land will be found again.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "47267889-5263124369-72157629214343130", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5263124369/#comment72157629579439783", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331673816", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosskayree] Happy to oblige, and so I've changed the title!
