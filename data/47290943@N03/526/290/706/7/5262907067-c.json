Four masters ad an. 1584) stand on the verge of the sea, Pouldoody bay, not far from Mr. Ryan\u2019s cottage. They present the appearance of long decay; one-half only of the castle has survived the shock which razed on the reminder to the foundation. The partially demolished arches and hanging vaults yet unfallen seem like a sad monumental mourner pausing in melancholy silence over the prostrate wreck of kindred walls and sidelong towers which lie around them. The desolate keep of Muckinish is now one of the many memorials in Ireland, pointing back to that ruthless puritanical spirit when scourged the land in days long gone by. Some of the fallen masses of masonry here strewed around are very large, and still exhibit entire the prostrate apertures once used for windows, chimneys, and portholes. Adjoining the castle are the remains of a more modern illicit malt kiln, contrived to serve the double purpose of drying malt and burning lime. The gently-rising hill of Muckinish will amply repay the autumnal visitor for the trouble of ascending it, by presenting him with an enchanting prospect, which embraces the ruined castle just described, relieved by rich corn fields, the sea, and Beha mountain in the distance.\n\nHistorical and poetic\n\nGeeze, another death on here. eww", "authorname": "oaktree_brian_1976", "id": "47267889-5262907067-72157632728153753", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5262907067/#comment72157632728177887", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1360471024", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.geograph.ie/photo/954099\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.geograph.ie/photo/954099</a> This seems a bit sad.

The coastline in\nthe immediate area is dominated by outcropping limestone which extends along the shoreline\nout to sea. However on the west side of the castle, the outcropping limestone has been removed\npossibly for construction purposes (relating to the castle) but it also provides an area where it\nwould be feasible to pull up a boat. The area measures approximately between 10m \u2013 17m wide.\nAppraisal\nThis is a striking location with the ruined medieval castle perched on a rock out-crop\noverlooking the sea.
