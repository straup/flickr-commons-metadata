The Glenbeigh Hotel enjoys good business in accommodation and food to this day and, despite the change in transportation, many locals and tourists stop there. In the days before Planning and Sustainable Development was buzzed about by everyone it is clear the owners of this hotel understood it.  Note the wide 'car park' opposite the hotel and that is there to this day.  The carriage is on its way to Tralee or Killarney and the man who got off it looks pretty snug in his long overcoat.  The other man in overcoat is reluctant to drag himself away from the woman, so the horses and carriage stand still  waiting for him in the middle of the road.  What an easygoing time it was.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "47267889-5263735688-72157629562995721", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5263735688/#comment72157629563094597", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331495246", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosskayree] I will replace this one with a higher res version, so that we can all see more detail, especially with the passengers/luggage, etc.", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-5263735688-72157629563094597", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5263735688/#comment72157629232292344", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331905177", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosskayree] Image now replaced!
