Dingle.  Dingle town is also a must see.\nNice restaurants featuring the local fish and the scenery is to die for.  The best thing\nis to start at Tralee and do the coast road along the peninsula....or you can also try the\nO'Connor Pass which will keep you glued to your seat...a bit scarey, but the view from the\ntop and down is unreal...you just might love it!!", "authorname": "momaloney", "id": "47267889-5263735238-72157625938824305", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5263735238"}}
