Next door that low house is now Durty Nellie's which is a pub and restaurant\nand a must to visit.  It is a fun place and if you want a peaceful dinner, then go to the\nsecond floor which is over the bar and it is much quieter.  The food is excellent and\nwe eat there every trip as it is on the road to the Airport.  There are also now shops\nnext to Durty Nellie's and then down the road are some excellent ones featuring all\nitems made in IReland.  I have purchased many things there.", "authorname": "momaloney", "id": "47267889-5263518218-72157626064278052", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5263518218"}}
