I was recently rereading James Stephens' <b><i>An Insurrection in Dublin</i></b>, and came across this passage pertinent to the Gunpowder Office -- Stephens identifies the building as Kelly's Fishing Tackle without mentioning the Gunpowder Office, but it's the same building:\n\n<blockquote>&quot;I was looking on O'Connell Bridge and Sackville Street, and the house facing me was Kelly's\u2014a red-brick fishing tackle shop, one half of which was on the Quay and the other half in Sackville Street. This house was being bombarded.\n\n&quot;I counted the report of six different machine guns which played on it. Rifles innumerable and from every sort of place were potting its windows, and at intervals of about half a minute the shells from a heavy gun lobbed in through its windows or thumped mightily against its walls.\n\n&quot;For three hours that bombardment continued, and the walls stood in a cloud of red dust and smoke. Rifle and machine gun bullets pattered over every inch of it, and, unfailingly the heavy gun pounded its shells through the windows.\n\n&quot;One's heart melted at the idea that human beings were crouching inside that volcano of death, and I said to myself, &quot;Not even a fly can be alive in that house.&quot;\n&quot;No head showed at any window, no rifle cracked from window or roof in reply. The house was dumb, lifeless, and I thought every one of those men are dead.\n\n&quot;It was then, and quite suddenly, that the possibilities of street fighting flashed on me, and I knew there was no person in the house, and said to myself, &quot;They have smashed through the walls with a hatchet and are sitting in the next house, or they have long ago climbed out by the skylight and are on a roof half a block away.&quot; Then the thought came to me\u2014they have and hold the entire of Sackville Street down to the Post Office. Later on this proved to be the case, and I knew at this moment that Sackville Street was doomed.\n\n&quot;I continued to watch the bombardment, but no longer with the anguish which had before torn me. . . .&quot;</blockquote>\n\nStephens later writes:\n\n<blockquote>&quot;About five o'clock the guns eased off of Kelly's.\n\n&quot;To inexperienced eyes they did not seem to have done very much damage, but afterwards one found that although the walls were standing and apparently solid there was no inside to the house. From roof to basement the building was bare as a dog kennel. There were no floors inside, there was nothing there but blank space; and on the ground within was the tumble and rubbish that had been roof and floors and furniture. Everything inside was smashed and pulverised into scrap and dust, and the only objects that had consistency and their ancient shape were the bricks that fell when the shells struck them.&quot;</blockquote>", "authorname": "petersondublin", "id": "47267889-6828772647-72157629182055530", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6828772647/#comment72157629546637299", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "75671375@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1331303274", "_content": "There's another photo of the Gunpowder Office just after the rising on this teachnet.ie page for 26 April 1916:\n<a href=\"http://resources.teachnet.ie/dhorgan/2004/wednesday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">resources.teachnet.ie/dhorgan/2004/wednesday.html</a>", "authorname": "petersondublin", "id": "47267889-6828772647-72157629546637299", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6828772647/#comment72157629188529074", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331387708", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/75671375@N05] Wow!
