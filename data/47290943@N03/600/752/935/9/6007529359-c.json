Referring specificially to 'Irish251'\ncomments, I would agree about 1973 being questionable. The photograph contains at least 3 Coras Iompair Eireann buses. These are Leyland 'OPD Titans', better known as the 'R' class. The green livery, (which pre-dated CIE) was replaced in 1961 by the 'monstral blue &amp; cream'. Given the then CIE practice of overhauling buses in Inchicore every 3 years, it is unlikely that this livery would have survived in big numbers much beyond 1965/6? \nThe bus closest in the picture, (northbound on O Connell St) is almost certainly  a member of the so called 'Bolton Class'  (R291-390)? These buses unlike most of their counterparts were purchased off the shelf by C.I.E. (to Bolton Corporation spec -hence the name!). They were most distinct, in that the upper rear windscreen was split, making them almost unique. This bus has this feature as far as I can see. These were all withdrawn by 1967. If this is indeed a 'Bolton' type?, it would date the photograph pre 1967.\n\nThe advertising carried on the buses in the picture is painted directly onto the bodywork. This was the norm. This practice ceased in the early 1960,s when vinyl took over. \n\nIn summary the bus would certainly date the picture pre 1967, but given the overall ambiance I feel it is mid to late 1950,s? The Citroen DS would set another timeline beyond 1955. \n\nClearly it is beyond 1955 (by virtue of the Citroen).
