This is not a characteristic of the lens but a common fault created at the time of taking by the photographer. In darkroom days it was corrected by tilting the baseboard on which the photographic paper was held to correct the verticals, so this flaw would be present in many old negatives as correction took place in the darkroom and not the camera. Later plate cameras incorporated a rising front and dropping back which allowed correction to take place in camera. SLR cameras had special lenses called tilt and shift which allowed correction at time of taking and are still used by some in this digital age. but most photographers use the vertical alignment feature which is present in many post processing programs, photoshop being just one of them.", "authorname": "martindevlin", "id": "47267889-7406535874-72157630204996070", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7406535874/#comment72157630205331330", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1340186203", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/photoken04] Ken as the shooter chose a slightly different position to take the shot the angles are slightly different which may have caused the change in leaning.
