I'm assuming that should be <i>Humming</i>! The photo was taken somewhere in the South-East of Ireland, and p.s. checked some newspapers for around that period, but could find no mention of them...\n\nThis photo has been here since 6 December 2012, without too much &quot;shtirring&quot;, but amazingly, here's info on two of the Humming Birds from <b>JoanMacA</b>:\n&quot;<i>I know the girl sitting on the ground at the front is my grandmother Nell Long, a singer, and the photo was probably taken in Waterford where she lived. The man second from the right is Mr. Bor, later to become famous under his stage name as the actor Max Adrian. Unfortunately I don't have any information as to who the Humming Birds were!</i>&quot;\n\n<b>JoanMacA</b> came back to us with further information on her grandmother, Nell Long, who's sitting on the ground at the front:\n&quot;<i>Yes my granny died in Oct 92. She was a professional singer and lived in John's Hill, Waterford City and then in Tramore, Co. Waterford.</i>&quot;\n\nAnother contribution has come in on Nell Long, or Ellen Millicent Long, to give her full name. <b>Rosieredser</b> says that Nell/Ellen:\n&quot;<i>was born in June 1908, to William Joseph Long (Commissioner for Oaths in Waterford), originally from Co Tipperary and his second wife Alice (formerly Aldred of Lancashire). Mr Long lived on John's Hill (1911 Census states 11 Daisy Terrace, John's Hill). The family later moved to a house (&quot;Arcadia&quot;) on Priest Road, Tramore.\nNell, as she came to be known, had two other sisters, Alice Mary (fondly known as Bunty) and Wendy and a step sister, Maureen (from William's first marriage to an Emily Kate, who sadly died in childbirth) who must have been born in 1902, judging from the 1911 census. The family were very involved in the 'light opera' scene in the 20s+, in Waterford.\nNell/Ellen married shortly after this picture was taken and moved to Scotland. Nell had three children, Peter, Timothy and Millicent, 10 grandchildren and many great grandchildren. The family moved back to Waterford, when Millicent was approx two and a half years old. Further details are being kindly supplied by Waterford City Archive, who have been supremely helpful in helping with historical information. Judith Whitton nee Paxton</i>&quot;\n\nPeg Torrie is sitting on the chair at the right. She was identified by Sylvia Torrie, who was kind enough to phone me from Waterford last Thursday. Peg was an aunt of Sylvia's husband. Peg was born around 1893, so would have been around 31 at the time this photo of the Humming Birds was taken, and Sylvia confirmed that the Humming Birds were a Waterford group. Peg Torrie died in 1982, aged 90. She was a great friend of Guy Bor (aka later famous actor Max Adrian, second from right in back row). Around the time this photo was taken, Guy/Max worked in the bank in Waterford, before moving to England. Peg Torrie and Guy Bor/Max Adrian remained lifelong friends, corresponding often and Peg visited Guy/Max at his home in Surrey, England. Apparently, there is a letter from Peg Torrie in Trinity College's Manuscript Department describing the Troubles in Waterford in 1922 during the Irish Civil War.\n\nFlabbergasted at what I found on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Adrian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr Bor/Max Adrian</a>!\n\nAnd for a glorious technicolour version, see <b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slimdandy/6475681805/in/photostream\" target=\"_blank\">slimdandy's</a></b> photostream.\n\nAs Joy Bagster told us that this photo was taken at a Concert Party in Tramore, I'm just placing this photo on Tramore on the Map in the hope that further information will allow us to pinpoint an exact location...\n\n\nDate: Saturday, 6 December 1924\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/P_WP_3237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">P_WP_3237</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9841", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1924-12-06 10:18:58", "lastupdate": "1374054422", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1323166738"}, "originalsecret": "48090262ca", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "Nell Long, singer, who lived in Waterford, id-ed by <b>JoanMacA</b>, whose grandmother Nell was...", "author": "47290943@N03", "h": "79", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "w": "65", "y": "224", "x": "206", "id": "72157629064274612"}, {"_content": "Mr Bor / actor Max Adrian, id-ed by <b>JoanMacA</b>", "author": "47290943@N03", "h": "73", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "w": "66", "y": "41", "x": "330", "id": "72157629064283664"}, {"_content": "Peg Torrie, id-ed by Sylvia Torrie", "author": "47290943@N03", "h": "80", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "w": "41", "y": "124", "x": "345", "id": "72157629438374501"}]}, "server": "7171", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6465119121/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
