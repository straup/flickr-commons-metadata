Last week he put off in a boat with two workmen with the object of breaking up the bull. They took with them a week's provisions and have since been living on the orck under canvas. Owing to the gale that has been blowing on the coastfor the past five days they have been unable to come ashore.\n\nSignals of distress have been flying since Saturday, but the high seas have so far made it impossible for boats to put out to rescue them from their perilous position.</i>\n\n\n\nI don't know what happened to Mr Murphy and his men.
