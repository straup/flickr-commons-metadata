Towards the end of September they had taken to building a house of coal tiles against all eventualities. Nor was the precaution take much too soon. The closing ice crushed the Hansa in spite of their strenuous efforts to ease her, and at the last they had to lend a hand to her destruction, cutting her loose from their floe in the fear that she might overstrain it. Fortunately, they had saved enough to make life tolerably easy to them in the meantime, and they had secured the three boats to which they looked for their ultimate rescue. If life in the ice-drift threatened at first to be monotonous, they soon found they would have nothing to complain of in the way of incident. They were disturbed by horrible noises under the ice, noises which meant they were rasping and grind on sunken rocks that might shiver them to destruction at any instant. They escaped that danger only to experience others, when subaqueous forces threatened to break up their raft; and when at last it began to melt with the warmth of returning Spring, they lived in dripping wretchedness as well as hourly anxiety. They had been on it for 200 days when they betook themselves to the boats, and set out on their voyage to the settlements on the south-western mainland. Suffice it to say that after perils by ice and perils by storm, after suffering sharply from hunger and still more from anticipation of absolute starvation, they finally made their way to Julianshaab, where they obtained a passage to Germany on board a Danish brig, after most inhospitable and uncourteous behaviour on the part of the Danish Governor.</i></blockquote>\n\nThe privations suffered by the crew of the other ship in the expedition, the steamer Germania, which survived the trip, sound even worse.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-8660291376-72157633369149920", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8660291376/#comment72157633373867076", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92418093@N08", "iconserver": "8257", "datecreate": "1367183808", "_content": "Thanks for that, Mr Spooner - fascinating stuff (I also read (after Bing translation) the article about the construction and trials of the Germania, from your polarfart link.
