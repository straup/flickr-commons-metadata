Its passage across Ireland was described in daily and regional newspapers; though many have little or no local information. Locally the Wicklow Newsletter had reports, 23rd October to the end of November, from Bray, Greystones, Wicklow and Arklow, but none from the mountains.

They first reached the Glance, a first class mackerel boat (Thomas Kavanagh) about five miles offshore. It was boarded and brought back to port with difficulty as it had been holed and would not have survived much longer. Next found was the Green Flag (Neill &amp; Hannigan), about half a mile from the bank and eight miles from the harbour. It was boarded by Daniel, Patrick and Andrew Neill, sons of the owner, and Peter Waddock and brought back safely, as was the Jackdaw (J. Reynolds) by a crew of three. The Safe Return (W. Canterbury) caused problems as she drifted dismasted between Glassgonnan Bank and Arklow Rock about six and a half miles from shore. The first attempt to rescue her failed when the first man to attempt boarding her (Kendall) fell into the sea and was rescued with difficulty. However, nearby was the undamaged Mary Francis (Mrs. Kearon), and she was used to tow the former back to harbour.
