Taken from the new bridge..\n<img src=\"http://photopol.com/pics/orwell_walk_weir_1.jpg\" />\n\nI lived in Orwell Gardens around 1950-54 long before the local authority paid any attention to the regular flooding in the Gardens. At that time we used to cross the river by homemade stepping stones, maintained by local communal effort. That way we could walk along the far bank to Dartry and get the No.14 bus to Rathmines or town.\n\nThe new bridge was built long after I left, but I was very impressed when I went back in 2006 and saw both it and what the authorities had done to seriously upgrade the park on the other side.\n\nThe authorities have provided a nice seat in the park near the bridge, and the sculptor has sculpted his phone number onto it in case you need a nice garden seat or a gravestone.\n\n<img src=\"http://photopol.com/pics/orwell_seat.jpg\" />\n\nIf I'm wrong about the weir, feel free to delete this comment.", "authorname": "photopol", "id": "47267889-8364225928-72157632540635528", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8364225928/#comment72157632540966638", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1358370142", "_content": "From chatting about this photo with my family, I have learned that my great-great-grandfather used to work in Waldron's Calico print works, where the sawmill is in this picture!", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-8364225928-72157632540966638", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8364225928/#comment72157632536484225", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1358370438", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley] Excellent!
