As I said above, she was born in 1916. She knew the building instantly and recalls going in to it many times as a child. She estimates this was taken at some time between c.1919-1923. So I'm pleased to report the following:\na) It's definitely the Post/Telegraph Office in Adrigole on the Beara Peninsula;\nb) The sign on the side of the building (which is unreadable in the photo) DID say: 'Adrigole Post Office'.\nc) Peg recalls that when you went in the front door of the building you had to turn right into the area that was the Post Office - it was also a small grocery store.\nd) Jeremiah Cronin IS the man in the photo - he WAS a teacher at the Adrigole National School (which is still located just out of the shot to the right of this shot - and where Peg went to school); he taught the boys whose classrooms were on the ground floor - girls' classrooms were on the first floor; it was his wife who was the Postmistress/shopkeeper. Although the census does refer to her full name of 'Hannah', Peg recalled the she was always known as 'Nan';\ne) The photograph has been taken from bend in the road (on the south side of the Adrigole River) - the Glengarriff to Castletownbere road crosses the river on a bridge which is just out of shot on the right of the house - and then turns left to go behind the house in the photo. The very recognisable rock formations of Adrigole Mountain seen in the background of the shot are almost unchanged today.\nf) Peg says that the post box for sending letters was situated by the side of the road (at the end of the small fence you can see on the right of the shot). Mail was collected daily and went to Bantry for sorting. \ng) She confirmed that there was no electricity into this (or any other building in Adrigole!) until MUCH later.\nh) It couldn't have been long after this shot was taken that the Post Office location moved to a house across the road (currently referred to as 'Bridge House'). It remained there until the 'new' Adrigole shop and Post Office (now known as 'Peg's Shop') was built and opened in 1933.\ni) This building is still standing. It has been totally renovated and enlarged (it has a two-storey extension on the right of the building shown in the shot) and is used as a holiday home. Trees and undergrowth have grown up in front of the house making an up-to-date comparative view impossible to take. However, I have taken shots of the house from within the garden area to the left if anyone would be interested to see them uploaded.\n\nHope this helps. Peg was fascinated to see the photo and delighted to be of assistance - we laughed that she could remember all of this, but wouldn't have a clue what she had for dinner two nights ago...\n\nPeg started working at the Adrigole Post Office (located in the 'new' shop - owned by her aunt) in 1934. Here she trained to be a Postmistress. She recalls: <i>&quot;We were busy all the time - in those days there were only two other telephones in the whole parish, so we took all the calls and dealt with all the mail and pensions. I used to deliver telegrams out to the houses around the parish on my bike, sometimes three or four miles, but I didn't mind I was cycling a lot of the time.&quot;</i>\n\nShe left Adrigole and worked in Post Offices in North Kerry until returning to Adrigole in 1948 as here aunt was sick and she needed Peg to run the shop and Post Office.\n\nShe's been here ever since, and was still sorting this morning's newspapers out when I called in to see her with this photo.", "authorname": "BearaBoy", "id": "47267889-8366240991-72157632653611435", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8366240991/#comment72157632654907983", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1359652031", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/92418093@N08] BearaBoy -  Fantastic story, well done for following up.
