In the All Ireland Review, 1902, the following quote is attributed to him (and not with much admiration either): \nDr. Grimshaw sums up the results of his comparisons between 1841 and 1890 in the\nfollowing terms: &quot;I have shown, by taking many tests, and applying them each in turn, that Ireland has advanced in the arts of civilization and in material prosperity. Whether she has done so at an equal rate with other countries is a question I have not ventured to discuss ; but many valuable statistics necessary for its solution could be collected and compared. Possibly she might have advanced more than she has done, but when we consider the mighty collapse that took place at the commencement of the past half century, which began in the days of the great famine of 1846, '47, and '48, it may be that Ireland has advanced more rapidly and recovered from a condition of almost total wreck more completely than any other country would have done or ever has done.&quot;\n\n... well that's nice.", "authorname": "MKSeery", "id": "47267889-6802929622-72157629512688561", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6802929622/#comment72157629513497367", "realname": "Stuart", "path_alias": null, "author": "23885771@N03", "iconserver": "3401", "datecreate": "1330902079", "_content": "Dreadful architecture that new Passport Office building !\nConsider those in the Corpo who consistently voted for the destruction of Dublin's fine Victorian and Georgian heritage.
