In the early 1920s, a Mrs White was on the Waterford County Board of Health. In the late 1920s, a Mrs White was a Councillor on Waterford Corporation. And around similar times, a Mrs E. White was involved with Infirmary and Hospital administration and fund raising, so I'd say it's safe-ish to assume this is <b>our</b> Mrs E. White.\n\nThe following extracts from various years of the Munster Express give some flavour of Mrs White's activities:\n\nAt a meeting of the County Board of Public Assistance, Mrs White said that the destitution in Waterford was appalling, and:\n<i>&quot;she wanted to point out how exceedingly inadequate the amount given towards the relief of unemployment was. She found men with large families, some with four or five children, who were only getting about 8/- or 10/- a week, and that was given in the form of food tickets. As a result, these poor people had food for a part of the week only. But, in addition, they were left without any money to provide coal, clothing, or to pay any rent. In consequence, these poor people were getting almost hopelessly into debt ... Such a state of things was terrible...&quot;</i>(Munster Express, Friday, 22 January 1926)\n\nAt a meeting of Waterford Corporation and the County Board of Public Assistance, Mrs. White said: <i>&quot;... there was a large number of the very poor congregated in the city ...&quot;</i> (Munster Express, Friday, 15 July 1927)\n\nShe was vice-chairman(!) of the Waterford County Board of Public Assistance. She was re-elected at a meeting in July 1927 because of the <i>&quot;whole-hearted interest taken by Mrs. White in the business of this and other boards and committee's</i> [sic].&quot; (Munster Express, Friday, 29 July 1927)\n\nMrs. White was at a Public Health Committee meeting where there was talk of a report regarding tenements.
