And (I know this is a long shot) could that possibly be a linen factory in the background?\n  Since my last posting I've asked fifteen people for their opinion. Unfortunately the only farmer who had grown flax had grown it as a feed crop for cattle.He said it COULD be flax, but he was not sure. Ten of the fiften said they just didn't recognise the crop at all, three said rather rudely that the photo was too indistinct to make anything out and the other chap said something like 'I've never grown flax, but this isn't hay and it doesn't look like any grain crop I have ever seen, and it IS Ireland - a land famous for its linen - so maybe it is flax.'\n  Sorry, it's not a conclusive result, but so far I can't come up with anything that is more helpful.", "authorname": "Jack Falstaff", "id": "47267889-5984094240-72157628930276979", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5984094240/#comment72157628931338259", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1326924543", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jack_falstaff] The cheek of them (the three rudie ones)!
