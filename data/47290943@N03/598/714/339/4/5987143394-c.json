The company had a daily newspaper, and printed all kinds of material for businesses.  The shop included several printing presses and six Linotype machine.  My wife of 55 years was a linotype operator when we met.  I did routine maintenence on the Linotypes, served as a substitute proof reader, wrote news, and did just about anything else that was needed. I was the &quot;fill in&quot; guy.\n\nLinotypes always facinated me.  They were very complex machines, but easy to operate.  They had a charactistic sound, with lots of clicking and clattering.  I sometimes found that I was proofing galleys, setting corrections on the Linotype, and inserting the new slugs into the galley.  I worked in the shop, the casting room, the press room and the editorial office, always as the fill in.  \n\nAt times, I covered the &quot;police beat&quot; which included the firehouse, courthouse, police department, and city hall.  \n\nSometimes I wonder if I learned as much at the college as I did at the print shop. Between the two, I think I got a good education.", "authorname": "Howard33", "id": "47267889-5987143394-72157627307700586", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5987143394/#comment72157627307882248", "realname": "AMTER", "path_alias": "amter", "author": "65109745@N08", "iconserver": "6015", "datecreate": "1311946473", "_content": "fascinating Howard...", "authorname": "AMTER", "id": "47267889-5987143394-72157627307882248", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5987143394/#comment72157627307938450", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1311947131", "_content": "Certainly sounds like it, Howard!
