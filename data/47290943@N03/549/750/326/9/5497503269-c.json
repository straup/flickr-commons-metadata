The goat has it's back to the camera, other than the scaffolding which Puck is standing on there is little foreground detail other than two children shading their eyes from a very bright sun which is lighting the left hand side of the street while the right hand side is partly in shade and a market stall obscures a lot of the detail in the lower left hand side while the banners going to the tower should be read from the other side. Shooting from the other side of the tower would have made a much better picture and a more experienced photographer would have waited until the sun was at a different angle and taken the shot from further down the street. An Ideal location would have been placing the camera on a window sill on one of the buildings further down the street. Why a window sill? plate cameras of the type used at this time were heavy bulky and usually mounted on a wooden tripod, film speeds were slow and even in bright sunlight as in this image shutter speeds could be down to about 1/10 (one tenth) of a second which would make it impossible to hand hold the camera also focusing and viewing was done on the back of the camera (no viewfinder) under a black cloth.  This shot would be the type of test that an apprentice would be sent out to photograph to see what they would return with, so as their employer could evaluate their camera craft. On reflection, I think what we are looking at here is an apprentice's work piece, simular to furniture makers apprentices making miniature pieces,\n \nFYI I have worked as a photographer for 25 years mostly shooting B&amp;W, still shooting but in a non professional capacity.", "authorname": "martindevlin", "id": "47267889-5497503269-72157630447653844", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5497503269/#comment72157630447689004", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1341572947", "_content": "Further down on the left, <a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Kerry/Killorglin/Main_Street/1417347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel Hayes</a>, baker.
