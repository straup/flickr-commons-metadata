Shannon Rowing Club in the centre still stands though no longer the force it was in Iris rowing.  On the left you can see parts of the Limerick Boat Club which is still there also.  The portion of the bridge you see once swung in an arc to permit movement of boats and small ship to go beyond what is now Sarsfields Bridge.  The statue on the left I was led to believe as a child was the son of the Lord Gough whose statue was blown up a number of times in the Phoenix Park.  They were more successful with this one as the poor lad ended up in the Shannon.   In fact as phlgils states below it was of John Fitzgibbon who died during the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balacalva!  It has been replaced by a memorial to the 1916 uprising having statues of people with local connections therein.  The building you can see on the right was either part of or beside Spillanes or Clunes tobacco factory and was still there into the 1950's.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-5691906148-72157627432524765", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5691906148/#comment72157627564296572", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1314821494", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/swordscookie] Excellent!
