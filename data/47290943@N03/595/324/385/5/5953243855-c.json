This photo was taken on 19 July 1900, and there are 4 children, one daughter and 3 sons (going by dress habits for young boys in that era).\n\nThe 1901 census, taken on 31 March 1901, has a Curran family living at 6 Bridge Street, but now  we're down to 3 children in total: Kathleen, 8; Michael, 7; and Edmund, 3.\n\nDon't know about you, but 3 of these children look as if those ages of 8, 7, and 3 would tally with their ages 8 months after this photo was taken. Wonder if one of the littlest boys had died...\n\nHave a look for yourselves: <a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001234756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001234756/</a>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-5953243855-72157627231911128", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5953243855/#comment72157627232536876", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "55597723@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1311089234", "_content": "Nice Photo.
