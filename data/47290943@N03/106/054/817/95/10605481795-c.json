I came across this in a publication entitled \u2018Reminiscences of Waterford\u2019 where I read that the first plantation of Tobacco ever grown commercially in this country was sown by Messrs. Power and Co. at Glenville in the early thirties. Schoolboys of today at De la Salle College may interested to learn that experimental plots of Tobacco were successfully grown there in 1932! \nPower\u2019s Nurseries was developed there on the lands which were formerly part of the Goff estate of Glenville, the latter being described in fascinating detail by Annabel Davis-Goff in her autobiographical \u2018 Walled Garden\u2019. Snowcream was developed in the early 1950\u2019s on another part of the estate near Glenville House itself.\n Tobacco growing and curing became a significant industry here employing as many as 40 women in the processing plant itself. In September 1933, the Irish Government provided the expertise of a Mr Keller, on loan from the US Department of Agriculture, to advise William and Frank Power of the Nurseries and up to 40 farmers and growers on how to best plant, harvest and cure the crop of tobacco. It was realized at an early stage that to be successfully commercially viable a Curing Rehandling station was required. Frank Power offered to provide 50% of the cost of the facility and was supported further by the other growers which later extended into Wexford and Kilkenny.\n\nThe Big Smoke\n\nWaterford could indeed have been described as the \u2018Big Smoke\u2019 in that cigar tobacco was grown from the \u2018Halliday\u2019 and Zimmer Spanish\u2019 varieties. The Waterford Station as it was known, grew in importance and production of the crop further extended into counties Cork, Carlow and Meath. This commercial crop appealed to farmers as it had only a 4-month grow cycle. The seed was sown in a \u2018hot bed\u2019 in mid-March and picked off in April into a mild hot bed or pots and then could be planted out by the 3rd week of May. Harvesting could then commence by the first week of August starting with the lower leaves and then working upwards until harvesting was complete. \nThe scale of the local tobacco industry can be gauged by the fact that between 1934 and 1945, the Station at Glenville yielded over one million pounds in revenue- a huge sum back then. This followed the imposition of a levy on home grown tobacco in the year of 1934. At its peak, the Station on the Dunmore Road was processing up to 100 bales a week.\nThe late Paddy McGuire of McGuires Garden Centre, Woodstown, worked at Power\u2019s Nurseries for over 30 years and joined the company towards the end of the tobacco growing era. Chatting to him some years ago about this enterprise, he recalled the teams of women working there on the tobacco production, curing and curling as they sang away as they worked. It\u2019s the sort of scene we associate today with the cigar factories of Cuba. It came as a surprise to me to have learned that tobacco was so widely grown here in the South-East and that the very hub of this industry was on the Dunmore Road itself. Growing declined after World War II and companies such as Player-Wills reverted to imported tobacco products and local production finally ceased in 1949.\n\nPowering Away\n\nPower Seeds and their nurseries continued to thrive here for many years but scaled back their operation at Glenville in the 70\u2019s and gradually transferred their growing seed business to Ballymountain across the river and today trades very successfully as SeedTech with Roy Power in time taking over from his father Declan. Roy has greatly expanded their sophisticated seedtech business over the past ten years. He represents the fifth generation of Powers who have literally grown the business into its third century since it was established by his great-grand father William Power in 1858 when he opened a nursery shop in King\u2019s Street (now O\u2019Connell Street).", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-10605481795-72157637203354404", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10605481795/#comment72157637218147665", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1383389854", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/33577523@N08] Photo of William G.D.
