Sergeant Harrison was quite a young man. He was in the South Irish Horse for some years, and during the special recruiting campaign in Waterford in March, 1915, he joined the cadet corps of the Leinster Regiment. He has been for some time at the front, and, although his death is not officially announced, there appears to be little doubt but that he has been killed, as the writer of one of the letters referred to stated that poor Jack Harrison was killed alongside of him, and that he only lived a short time after being struck. Amongst all who knew John Harrison he was very popular, and his death will be generally regretted. Deep sympathy will also be felt with his widow, father mother and other relatives in their bereavement.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/pages-in-history/newspaper-digitisation-pi/1916/county-waterford-officers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/page...</a>", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-6259642511-72157632673872632", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6259642511/#comment72157632670031799", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92847932@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1359834402", "_content": "Ofarrl, You've just made my day!
