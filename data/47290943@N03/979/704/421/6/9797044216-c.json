Dr. Joynt, on the previous occasion, stated in his evidence that the boy presented symptoms of acute poisoning, and the case was adjourned pending an analysis of the stomach of deceased, and some ice-cream similar to that which he was supposed to have eaten. Mr. Rabaiotti, who carries on his business in Amiens street, was examined, and deposed to the ingredients of his ice-cream, against the quality of which there had never been a complaint. His business at the bazaar was stopped about three o'clock on the 15th, when he gave a sample of the ice-cream to the police, who came back about 6.30 p.m. and said he might resume. Dr. McWeeney deposed to being unable to find any traces of poison in the ice-cream and wafers submitted to him for analysis. He ate one of the wafers and suffered no ill effects. The Coroner read for the jury a report from Sir Charles Cameron of his analysis of the viscera of deceased. So far as poison was concerned the result was negative. There was nothing in the appearance of the stomach or intestines to suggest corrosive poisoning. The liver was abnormal. The jury found that death was due to exhaustion, and exonerated Mr. Rabaiotti from all blame in connection with the matter.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9797044216-72157635611029715", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9797044216/#comment72157635612186383", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackpoolbeach", "author": "14302637@N08", "iconserver": "2335", "datecreate": "1379501218", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] I was looking for Forte's ice cream parlour in Washington, County Durham.\nI found this website.
