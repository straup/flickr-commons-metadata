Mayo\nThe Westport line was extended to Achill Sound in the 1890s. and this was one of the so-called 'Balfour Lines', called after Arthur J. Balfour, Chief Secretary for Ireland during the years 1887-91, who introduced the Act providing State assistance for the construction of narrow gauge lines to disadvantaged areas. The first station on this extension was Newport which opened in February 1894.\n\nOn of the most striking features of the Newport section of the line is the Viaduct which is featured in the  picture  on the left.\nCentre piece of Newport, the railway viaduct that once carried steam trains through Newport on their way to Achill, is now preserved as a walkway for native and visitor, to enjoy. It spans the Blackoak River, contains seven arches and cost \u00a37,640 to build. The overall length of the viaduct is 305ft (92m) and the width 18ft 6in. The viaduct is constructed of local red sandstone with some limestone facings. \n\nThe line was not opened until 1894 on completion of a nearby tunnel at the end of Newport Station.The first train crossed the bridge in February, 1894, and it was finally closed in September 1937.", "authorname": "Hello Kitkat", "id": "47267889-8508736621-72157632864754404", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8508736621/#comment72157632860198363", "realname": "Ciar\u00e1n Cooney", "path_alias": "flyingsnail", "author": "22919290@N08", "iconserver": "2352", "datecreate": "1361883801", "_content": "Excellent photograph. \nThe track appears laid as it is, known as 'flat-bottom rail' which featured no chairs attached to the sleepers. This type of track was eventually replaced throughout the system, but lightly used lines like that to Achill and Clifden were never upgraded and by the 1930s were totally life-expired, resulting in their premature demise (Achill line closing in 1937). The sleepers are covered in spoil and gravel, which in those days was a lot finer type than today. I also see there is a check rail visible to prevent any derailments. \nThe tunnels at Newport were two of only four constructed on the Midland Great Western, the others located at Galway, and Cross Gunns, Dublin.", "authorname": "Flying Snail", "id": "47267889-8508736621-72157632860198363", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8508736621/#comment72157632860597299", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1361887171", "_content": "Other shot is more panoramic...
