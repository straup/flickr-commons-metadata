This nice lady kindly posed for the photo and was dressed in an original Cumann na mBan uniform complete with insignia, holster and revolver (only the revolver was a replica, everything else was original). She also allowed me to take close-up pics of the badges. I can confirm that the above badge is a genuine original going by the style and details. Regret to say this badge is not my own, an original would cost anything upwards of \u20ac150 - if you can find one for sale! Buyers beware, there are moderns copies of this badge about of varying quality.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/23885771@N03/4942616077/in/set-72157624718960917]", "authorname": "RETRO STU", "id": "47267889-5966743306-72157627260819108", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5966743306/#comment72157627260915896", "realname": "Sarah", "path_alias": "sarahkmc", "author": "32149975@N07", "iconserver": "3030", "datecreate": "1311423389", "_content": "A relative of my mother was in the Cumann na mBan, I must show her this photo!", "authorname": "Sarah K Mc", "id": "47267889-5966743306-72157627260915896", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5966743306/#comment72157627139152585", "realname": "Angela Orlando", "path_alias": "maorlando", "author": "16489083@N05", "iconserver": "7428", "datecreate": "1311450692", "_content": "Wonderful post and comments!!", "authorname": "maorlando God kept us 2012 leaning on Him 2013", "id": "47267889-5966743306-72157627139152585", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5966743306/#comment72157631670552562", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "87900113@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1349131863", "_content": "Just a query on the date!
