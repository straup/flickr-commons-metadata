Evacuated and Burnt by the Anti-treaty forces on the night of the 21st July 1922 I think looted by Locals the following morning before being occupied by pro treaty forces.The yard is quite substantial in size indicating possibly a barracks square, timber frame possibly additional accommodation hut for British troops during the war of independence, there were several of these built on the square in the ordnance barracks. The timber frame doesn't look to be burnt but the reason only a frame and chicken wire remains maybe the looting of the galvanised or timber cladding from it? Low buildings in the rear MAY correspond with the low buildings against the perimeter of the barracks wall such as saddlers/stores/stables.
