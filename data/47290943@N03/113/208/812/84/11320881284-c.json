I find this one a bit intriguing. \n\nI had found the same census returns as yourself, and it's clear that 74 Thomas Street was a public house (probably with grocery component) at the 1901 and 1911 census. There's nothing to indicate that it was in use for an extended period as a shooting range. (Although those properties all have/had reasonably long yards and rooms, so one of the back rooms might have been used as a range for a period.) \n\nConfirming a date would be made easier if we could link &quot;The Fox and Co.&quot; to the property. However, I can't seem to find the company at all - not to mention any connection to Thomas Street. The only Fox connection (of any sort) to 74 Thomas Street would seem to be James Fox - a 16 year-old Na Fianna volunteer who died during the Rising at Stephen's Green. In some sources his address is given as 74 Thomas Street. Perhaps a family connection. Perhaps a coincidence.\n\nI went and (re)watched one of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqplwx0bp8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eamonn mac Thomais' marvelous pieces on the history of the Liberties</a> to see if he might mention something - but no such luck.
