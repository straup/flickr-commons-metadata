No mention of it before July 1892, but suddenly it was all the rage.\n\nIt seems to have been imported from America - in August the Alhambra brought Miss Jenny Joyce from America to perform it, but the Empire beat them by a week with Miss Estrella Sylvia . That didn't stop Lizze Don (of the Don sisters - the others were Lulu and Emma - who had spent 2 years in America) writing to The Era claiming to have been first. An advert in The Era in July backs this up this claim. Yet another dancer, Miss Loie Fuller, tried to copyright it, and some observers said Donato, the one-legged dancer, had performed something similar years earlier at Covent Garden.\n \nThat winter it featured in just about every panto in Britain, &quot;the inevitable serpentine dancer&quot;, as one reviewer put it.\n\nIt was still being performed in 1900, but with gimmicks. In Plymouth &quot;Miss Nellie does a serpentine dance on a rolling sphere&quot;, in Newport, &quot;Serpentine Dance by a Lady amongst the Lions&quot;,  in Merthyr Tydfil &quot;Miss Emmelines in a serpentine dance on a rolling globe&quot;, and at the Metropole &quot;a specially serpentine dance with wonderful kaleidescopic effect&quot;.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-11350333964-72157638634046285", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11350333964/#comment72157638636962954", "realname": "John Sanders", "path_alias": null, "author": "48236157@N02", "iconserver": "8442", "datecreate": "1386945459", "_content": "Love the artwork on the program!", "authorname": "TEXASJOHN", "id": "47267889-11350333964-72157638636962954", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11350333964/#comment72157638636763765", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "22736191@N08", "iconserver": "3721", "datecreate": "1386947671", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZcbntA4bVY\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZcbntA4bVY</a>", "authorname": "zippo22", "id": "47267889-11350333964-72157638636763765", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "11350333964"}}
