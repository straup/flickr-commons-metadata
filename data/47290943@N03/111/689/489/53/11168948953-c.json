The second baronet, Sir Robert Shaw (1769-1869), built the Circle Cottages that gave the name Roundtown to the new emerging village. \n\n.....In 1868, the Shaw family changed the name of Roundtown to Terenure, to recall their former home at Terenure House which had now become Terenure College. The family maintained its connections with Bushy Park until they sold the house and grounds to Dublin Corporation in 1953. The city council turned part of Bushy Park into a public park but then sold the house and part of the grounds to the nuns who founded Our Lady\u2019s School. \n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.patrickcomerford.com/2013/03/as-shutters-come-down-and-shops-close.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.patrickcomerford.com/2013/03/as-shutters-come-down-an...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-11168948953-72157638294259194", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11168948953/#comment72157638293936845", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1386020638", "_content": "=K=L=A=X=O=N=!=\n\nAccident with the Roundtown Omnibus No.7 in April 1861 - six people killed - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/102523096\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/102523096</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-11168948953-72157638293936845", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11168948953/#comment72157638296484813", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1386024566", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] I bet John Wilson, omnibus proprietor, nelsons lane,<a href=\"http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,715929,734674,7,7\" rel=\"nofollow\">OSI 6&quot;</a> Dublin and Islington, Rathgar, had a bad day.\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.ie/books?id=qUPkVPnrHQMC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=wilson+omnibus+negligence+byrne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BuW_IFgpVn&amp;sig=ZLkoSURaBkd0l6mYzOoyuUVHxec&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N5qIT5PZDMXDhAeJ3umyCQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson omnibus negligence byrne&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">A HEAD WRECK</a>\n\n<img src=\"http://siblingofdaedalus.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/portobello-bridge.jpg\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://siblingofdaedalus.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/she-wore-a-beautiful-dress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Wore a Beautiful Dress</a>\n\nNelson's Lane is now known as Earl Place.  <a href=\"https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=nelsons+lane+dublin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.34904,-6.258586&amp;spn=0.003189,0.008256&amp;sll=53.3834,-8.21775&amp;sspn=13.0758,33.815918&amp;hnear=Nelson+St,+Dublin,+County+Dublin&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.349175,-6.258721&amp;panoid=uuYEucRtTPDRbXHISd1gkQ&amp;cbp=12,340.13,,0,9.68\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetview </a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.libraryireland.com/Dublin-Street-Directory-1862/118.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.libraryireland.com/Dublin-Street-Directory-1862/118.php</a>\nWhen I first saw this I assumed Todd Burns was the omnibus company owner...eejit me for not reading the small print.
