Designed by the German architect Richard Castle, (1695-1751), who was working at nearby Carton for the Earl of Kildare, this singular piece of Irish architecture stands 140 feet tall with a soaring obelisk supported by a series of arches beneath. Built in 1740 by Katherine Conolly to provide employment, during the severe winter and subsequent famine of 1739/40, for the starving Castletown tenantry. Intended to mark the boundary of the Castletown demense it actually stood on part of the Carton estate. Dominating the local landscape it became a focal point for both the Castletown and Carton demesnes. In 1960, then in a ruinous state, it was acquired, thanks to the generosity of Mrs Rose Saul-Zalles, by the recently reconstituted Irish Georgian Society and its restoration was their first major project. In 1989 Mariga Guinness, one of the Societys co-founders was buried beneath one of the side arches. It is now in the care of the Office of Public Works.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.castletownhouse.ie/TouroftheHouse/TheConollyFollyorObelisk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.castletownhouse.ie/TouroftheHouse/TheConollyFollyorOb...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-11186576504-72157638311863326", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11186576504/#comment72157638314272284", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1386074832", "_content": "William Conolly \n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06/11188685216/]", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-11186576504-72157638314272284", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11186576504/#comment72157638314543816", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1386076731", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Here's a <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000288838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Mega Zoomable</b></a> engraving of Speaker Conolly...", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-11186576504-72157638314543816", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11186576504/#comment72157638319286854", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1386085380", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] very nice indeed.
