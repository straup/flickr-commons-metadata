But I did a quick scan of resources. \n\nThe photo puts that clock at #5 Bridge Street c.1900/1901. At that time #5 was (according to the <a href=\"http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/streetandtradedirectories/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Almanacs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Cork/North_East_Ward/Bridge_Street/1101587/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1901 Census</a>) occupied by a family of jewellers and watchmakers named Barriscale. Hence no big surprise that they had a handsome timepiece adorning their shop-front. The Barriscale's were a long established family of jewellers and watchmakers in Cork:\n<blockquote>\n* Slater's 1846 directory puts a Samuel Barriscale in a jeweller/watchmakers shop on Paul Street.\n* Guy's 1884 directory puts a William Barriscale (likely a descendant of the above) close-by operating as a jeweller/watchmaker on North Main Street (Crawford Art College records of the 1880s suggest he may have been a graduate - perhaps as a silversmith)\n* Guy's 1891 directory shows 5 Bridge street as vacant\n* However, by 1901 the Census puts William Barriscale (and HIS son Richard) at 5 Bridge Street\n* Guy's 1907 directory shows that William Barriscale was still at 5 Bridge Street\n* The same directory suggests that an RJ Barriscale (very likely Richard) had opened a jewellers/watchmakers in 12a Winthrop Street (incidentally a lovely building in itself. Now occupied by Minihan's Chemist)\n* Intervening directories show that the Barriscale shop operated on Bridge Street until at least 1921 (Richard had left the Winthrop Street shop by this time. Perhaps he moved away or back to Bridge Street to support his father - who would have been in his 70s by then)\n* Guy's 1945 directory however lists no Barriscale's operating as jewellers in Cork (Richard possibly having moved or passed away himself. And the elder William certainly having passed away by then)\n</blockquote>\n\nI know this doesn't answer the &quot;where's the clock?&quot; challenge, but perhaps it might prompt any remaining Barriscale's in Cork (of which there are a few) to shed some light. (Did Richard move and take it with him to a new premises? Did it stay at 5 Bridge Street for a time?)
