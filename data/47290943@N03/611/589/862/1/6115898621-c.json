Boys weren't &quot;breeched&quot; until they were toddlers or older. By the 1900s boys graduated from dresses at earlier ages, but it wasn't until the 1920s that rompers and similar became common. I've heard several theories as to why this was a tradition for so long. One I remember hearing was to disguise boys (more &quot;valuable&quot; targets given inheritance rules/etc) from being taken by fairies or human kidnappers. I'd suggest however that it was more hum-drum than that. A stitched pants suit or babygro is more complex and expensive to make than a simple gown. And a gown would take longer to grow out of. Hence stick all babies in cheap and long lasting gowns - regardless of gender :)", "authorname": "guliolopez", "id": "47267889-6115898621-72157627624493616", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6115898621/#comment72157627630470230", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1315575655", "_content": "A colleague here, who had also been told that dresses were to protect &quot;valuable&quot; boys from the clutches of wily fairies, found confirmation here: <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/britchange.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.pitt.edu/~dash/britchange.html</a> (scroll to bottom - <i>Dressing Boys in Girls' Clothes</i>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-6115898621-72157627630470230", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6115898621/#comment72157627550988679", "realname": "Stuart", "path_alias": null, "author": "23885771@N03", "iconserver": "3401", "datecreate": "1316079781", "_content": "What a fabulous and fun toy....beats the rocking-horse anytime.", "authorname": "RETRO STU", "id": "47267889-6115898621-72157627550988679", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6115898621/#comment72157632658063146", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1359642937", "_content": "Not much to go on in the census, so this is speculative, but I like <a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Waterford/Waterford_No__4_Urban__part_of_/John_s_Hill/670644/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hannah L.
