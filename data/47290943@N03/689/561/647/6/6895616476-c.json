This is where the 03.50 down Waterford goods was derailed on Good Friday 27 March 1959. Most CIE passenger trains were cancelled on that day (as was the practice at that period) and the local ganger decided to change some rails on the down road. Shortly after the work was due to commence, the look-out man was sent off to his post of duty to place detonators but before he could reach it, the ganger, sure that the goods must have long passed by, removed a length of rail. What he did not know was that on that particular morning the goods had been severely delayed in Kildare, and was trying to make up time on the falling gradient towards Monasterevan.\n\nTo the horror of the gang they saw the goods bearing down on them. The driver, Driver Mickey Harrington, braked hard but was unable to stop the loose-coupled train. The locomotive concerned was B101, a Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co. Sulzer locomotive of the A1A-A1A type, travelling at 45 mph, and some of the leading wagons of the train were derailed blocking both up and down lines. The leading wagons, containing sodium chlorate, went on fire and were either destroyed or badly damaged, although no-one was injured. While the line was closed train services were diverted via Carlow and Kilkenny to Abbeyleix and Portlaoise. The up line was reopened in the early hours of Saturday morning and the down line at 17.00 that same day. Three steam cranes from; Inchicore, Broadstone and Athlone, were used for clearing the debris from the track. Tragically, the Permanent Way Inspector at Portlaoise on hearing of the derailment suffered a heart attack and died.</i>", "authorname": "Flying Snail", "id": "47267889-6895616476-72157634985807779", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6895616476"}}
