As they drew near they were pressed by a crowd of men and women to take one for a guide ... </i></blockquote>\nThe incident ends with MacGregor having a fight on the bridge.\n<blockquote><i> ... his blood was up, and standing on the narrow plank with certain destruction before him if he over-balanced and fell, he buffeted the big bully with his knees, boxed him with his hands, kicked him with his feet, until at last he rose and scrambled over on all fours, followed by MacGregor </i></blockquote>\n\nIgnoring possible exaggeration over the years in the telling and retelling of the tale or in the interests of the book being a good read, and ignoring any possible slackness on the part of the biographer in checking dates and facts,  MacGregor was born in January 1825, and his 17th year when this incident is said to have taken place would be Jan 24th 1841 to Jan 24th 1842. So even as early as that, the bridge seems to have been somewhere to visit and where locals could augment their income by acting as guides  (even if their customer relations skills seem to have been wanting if, like MacGregor, you declined their services).\n\nEdit: the full text of the book is <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/johnmacgregorrob00hodduoft/johnmacgregorrob00hodduoft_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.
