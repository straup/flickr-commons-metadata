If its the 10th then the motorists (there were around nineteen of them at this stage) are about to set out on the second day's motoring from Waterford to Cork. It certainly could be the 9th in which case they have probably just arrived in Waterford at the end of the first day's motoring. So there's your choice... I think on balance I would go with the 9th as they look as if they are tired after a long days motoring, and not as if they are full of enthusiasm after a good nights sleep!\n\nRJ Mecredy, Editor of the Motor News magazine, is at the steering wheel of the car on the right. Not sure who the person with him is but I can probably find out as we have several first hand accounts of the Tour, including Mecredy's. RJ Mecredy was invariably known as 'Arjay' and was certainly the 'Father of Motoring in Ireland'. He was responsible for so many motoring milestones here and was beloved by a very wide readership.\n\nThe third passenger in Goff's car is almost certainly his chauffeur, 'Milne'. However, the role of the chauffeur was different then to what we understand now. When motoring first became possible in the late 1890s it was, to those lucky few who could afford it, another sporting past-time to add to hunting, shooting and fishing. So, the owner of the car was not going to deprive himself of the sport of driving the car. However, he needed a servant who could serve lunch when a stop was made on a journey or, more importantly, to fix the inevitable punctures that occurred on almost every journey.
