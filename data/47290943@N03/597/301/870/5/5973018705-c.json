Wonder why they work in that seemingly uncomfortable position? How long can they sit like that on hard wooden flooring?\n\nNow, I'm surmising here....it would be nice to know if the man standing to our right is Mr Hearne himself and the other two to the left perhaps clerks? The man standing near the centre could possibly be the shop governor (foreman) and looks to be a hard task-master?\n\nHeating? If there's no fireplace then a couple of paraffin (kerosene) heaters.
