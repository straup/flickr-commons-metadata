American Football, Lacrosse, Baseball, Athletics and Pigeon Shooting were among the games played in the stadium, which was originally conceived as a multi-sports club. \n\nAnd for the first 20 years cricket was a vital part of the mix as Ger Siggins explains in this exclusive extract from \u2018Lansdowne Road: The Stadium, The Matches, The Greatest Days\u2019\u2026. \n\nBack in <b>August 1874</b> cricket was still arguably the most widely played game in the land. Henry Dunlop had ambitions to challenge the supremacy of the Trinity club in its staging of lucrative annual matches against touring sides and English counties, and teamed up with publisher and sports goods seller John Lawrence to invite over the London Imperial Clowns for games against Eleven Gentlemen of Ireland. \n\nIt was a raucous Victorian version of Twenty20, with the Clowns being actual circus performers, augmented by some useful professionals. The Gentlemen of Ireland was a strong selection, with several of the best players of the day, including celebrated scholar and wit JP Mahaffy, who taught Oscar Wilde; and Leland Hone, who later played test matches for England. The play was interspersed with musical interludes while the Clowns entertained the audience with acrobatic fielding.\n \nThe Irish Times man was unimpressed: \u2018Many lovers of cricket objected to their game being burlesqued, and consequently absented themselves from a match where they expected nothing but buffoonery.\u2019 Not quite so generous was the man from Saunders Newsletter, who thought \u2018We may content ourselves now by hoping we ne\u2019er may look upon its like again. Buffoonery, through the medium of cricket, may amuse the village Yokels, or create a laugh in the circus, but we doubt much whether Irish gentlemen will again be found arrayed against such competitors in such costume.\u2019\n \nSadly for Lawrence, there was little spectator interest in such frivolity either, and the weather was no help: the attendance was described as \u2018wretched\u2019. He lost \u00a3100 on his promotion, which was not repeated. Ironically, Dunlop\u2019s rivals at the Leinster club put up a purse to attract the greatest cricketer of the age, W.G. Grace, who brought a huge crowd to Rathmines for a proper match a few weeks later.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES3/articles/000045/004530-p.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">From Cricket Europe - Ireland</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8455666538-72157632718265930", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8455666538/#comment72157632714124969", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1360330075", "_content": "The Mardyke is the home ground of Cork County Cricket Club, who have played there since their formation in 1874", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8455666538-72157632714124969", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8455666538/#comment72157632718413402", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1360330148", "_content": "Photograph taken from Victoria Road, Victoria/Albert Quay junction.
