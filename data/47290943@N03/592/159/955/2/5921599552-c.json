She contributed to it weekly for its three year existence from 1911 to 1914. The printers then grew afraid to print it.  She organised the feeding of three thousand children during the lockout and founded the Irish Women's Workers Union.  It had distinctive badges and the women here may be wearing them.  Davitt was dead since 1906 but W.M. Murphy, his fellow Nationalist, lived on to organise against the workers unions.  He owned Dublin Tramways and the Irish Independent. Delia is also in another picture in the collection after the women's imprisonment.
