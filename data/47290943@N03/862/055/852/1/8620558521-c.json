The Duchesses had larger 26 seat bodies.\n\nNugents also operated two larger Vulcan VWBL 31 seaters - TE 2039 and GD 5184 and a third larger 31 seat Vulcan CD 3158. \n\nAll of these vehicles would pass to the Great Northern Railway of Ireland in 1931 with 11 entering service (all except CD 3158) with IB 4404, IB 4689, TE 2039, GD 5184 passing to the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board in 1935.\n\nNugents were an early example of a cross border operation which became embroiled in the politics with vehicles registered in North and South and falling foul of political masters in two different countries. The company would later reappear as an independent operator once more but had ceased again by 1992.", "authorname": "billh35", "id": "47267889-8620558521-72157633173607014", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8620558521/#comment72157633168942799", "realname": "Robin Parkes", "path_alias": null, "author": "13073434@N03", "iconserver": "2837", "datecreate": "1365181974", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Quite right AZ - Belfast so the car is well away from home.
