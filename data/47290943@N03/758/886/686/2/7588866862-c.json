By 1895 the firm had become known as Carling, Gill &amp; Carling. Like many ironmongers, the business sold a vast range of goods, such as household items and agricultural equipment. It was also contracting as gas and water engineers, tinsmiths and whitesmiths and even bell hangers. They had several premises in Guildford as well as a branch in Godalming later on.</i>\n\nThe company went into liquidation in 1937.\n\nAlso, <a href=\"http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/GetRecord/SHCOL_1522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">evidence here</a> of a Henekeys at 58 High St. Guildford.", "authorname": "eyelightfilms", "id": "47267889-7588866862-72157630616489494", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7588866862/#comment72157630616514514", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34260314@N04", "iconserver": "3393", "datecreate": "1342513455", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/GetRecord/SHCOL_1645\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/GetRecord/SHCOL_1645</a>\nCarling Gill and Carling Ironmongers &amp; Heating Engineers Company of Guildford?", "authorname": "Conor1970", "id": "47267889-7588866862-72157630616514514", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7588866862/#comment72157630616581984", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1342513964", "_content": "Check the first floor windows:\n\n<a href=\"https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=guildford&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.2352,-0.575012&amp;spn=0.004924,0.006191&amp;sll=53.401034,-8.307638&amp;sspn=9.611144,12.678223&amp;hnear=Guildford,+Surrey,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.235115,-0.574899&amp;panoid=ULx_NGs2yhvo_vyHpmmKBQ&amp;cbp=12,46.08,,3,-5.49\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arch, arch, rectangle, rectangle, big bay</a>", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-7588866862-72157630616581984", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7588866862/#comment72157630616598752", "realname": "", "path_alias": "shanekillen", "author": "29492435@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1342514092", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley] Damn just beat me to it AGAIN !! \n\nIt's Guilford High Street", "authorname": "Cuddly Nutter", "id": "47267889-7588866862-72157630616598752", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7588866862/#comment72157630616616476", "realname": "Sean Ryan", "path_alias": "seanryan", "author": "34695930@N00", "iconserver": "3691", "datecreate": "1342514231", "_content": "I just looked at the same thing Niall!\n\nThe bay window looks to have been &quot;mock Tudorised&quot; since this photo was taken", "authorname": "_Harry Lime_", "id": "47267889-7588866862-72157630616616476", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7588866862/#comment72157630616671218", "realname": "-", "path_alias": "gerryward", "author": "8214568@N08", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1342514636", "_content": "Carling, Gil &amp; Carling were at <a href=\"http://www.planemakers-database.com/page/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">59 &amp; 60 High Street, Guilford</a>.
