Brooke repaired the tower, replacing the original slit windows with three- and four-mullioned windows to match those of the new three-story gabled manor house which he erected next to the tower. The tower roof was gabled and a huge bay window replaced the original entrance to the tower. Both Sir Basil and his son Sir Henry served as Governors of County Donegal. Henry sided with the Parliamentarians during the Civil War, losing Donegal Castle to Clanrickarde in a surprise attack. Sir Henry recaptured his castle just three days later, and his son Basil successfully defended the castle against the Jacobite forces under Sarsfield. The Brooke family owned the castle for many generations, but by the 18th century it had fallen into ruins. In 1898 the owner donated the castle to the Office of Public Works.\n\nfrom <a href=\"http://climbingthebranches.blogspot.ie/2012/03/saturdays-structure-donegal-castle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">climbingthebranches.blogspot.ie/2012/03/saturdays-structu...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9454962057-72157634969317634", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9454962057/#comment72157634962974859", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1375864436", "_content": "The Crest on the left is of the Brooke family\n\nsee <a href=\"https://www.virtuousplanet.com/shops/userimages/00006/00000000074/watermark/00000000000000049400.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.virtuousplanet.com/shops/userimages/00006/00000000074...</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9454962057-72157634962974859", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9454962057/#comment72157634969361166", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1375864640", "_content": "The Donegal Brooks started with Sir Basil Brooke, who, we are told, was responsible for the design of Donegal Town and the attractive Diamond.
