She must have married Thomas, twelfth Earl of Desmond, after 1505, as his first wife is known to have been alive in that year. Raleigh saw her in 1589, and she died in 1604: so it would seem that she must have been at least one hundred and ten or one hundred and twelve when she met her untimely death,\u2014a death brought about entirely by her own youthful impetuosity and her fondness for athletic sports. Robert Sydney, second Earl of Leicester, makes the following reference to her in his Table-Book, written when he was ambassador at Paris, about 1640:\u2014\n'The old Countess of Desmond was a marryed woman in Edward IV. time in England, and lived till towards the end of Queen Elizabeth, so she must needes be neare one hundred and forty yeares old. She had a new sett of teeth not long afore her death, and might have lived much longer had she not mett with a kinde of violent death; for she would needes climbe a nut-tree to gather nuts; so falling down she hurt her thigh, which brought a fever, and that fever brought death. This my cousin Walter Fitzwilliam told me.'\nIt is true that the aforesaid cousin Walter may have been a better raconteur than historian; still, local tradition vigorously opposes any lessening of the number of the countess's years, pinning its faith rather on one Hayman, who says that she presented herself at the English court at the age of one hundred and forty years, to petition for her jointure, which she lost by the attainder of the last earl; and it also prefers to have her fall from the historic cherry-tree that Sir Walter planted, rather than from a casual nut-tree\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1391/1391-h/1391-h.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gutenberg.org/files/1391/1391-h/1391-h.htm</a>", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9454984499-72157634967475631", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9454984499/#comment72157634971721189", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jimdoherty2302", "author": "36776977@N02", "iconserver": "2834", "datecreate": "1375913192", "_content": "very nice.", "authorname": "jim2302", "id": "47267889-9454984499-72157634971721189", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9454984499/#comment72157634971987723", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1375914814", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Yes, 'Penelope's Irish Experiences' is a good gossipy read, but to be taken with a large pinch of salt, I think.
