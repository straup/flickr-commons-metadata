In the RIAC Archive we have seven photographs, six of which are a sequence showing this car driving around the grounds of an estate and including the photograph you have posted. Back to the seventh photograph in a few minutes.\nFirst of all the driver is identified in our photographs as Colonel CP Dawson. In the 1907 edition of The Motorist\u2019s Year Book there is an entry for him as follows:\n\nDAWSON, Colonel C. P., Ross, County Galway. Cars: Leon Boll\u00e9e, Cl\u00e9ment, Panhard, Wolseley. Hobby: Mechanics. Introduced the first car into Connemara in 1897. Clubs: Naval and Military, Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nNow the car. A Leon Boll\u00e9e were very much the equivelent of a Ferrari in their day and were much copied. In Britain H J Lawson of British Motor Syndicate fame bought the patents with a view to manufacturing a copy, which he did through his company The Coventry Motor Company Limited of which Charles McRobie Turrell was the General Manager. The car thus produced was called the Coventry Motette., and there is a rare picture of it on page 79 of the October 1956 issue of The Veteran and Vintage magazine.\n\nAccles Limited was a general engineering firm that Charles McRobie Turrell joined in 1900 and shortly afterwards they produced their first car, a four-wheeler 10/15hp flat twin marketed as the Accles-Turrell. No mention of a three wheeled car. (Information from that bible of car makes, Nick Georgano\u2019s THE COMPLETE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MOTORCARS 1885-1968).\nSo, we have Colonel Dawson driving what is most likely a Coventry Motette.\nNow, the seventh photograph in the RIAC Archive \u2013 intrigueingly this is of the same Colonel Dawson (possibly photographed on the same occasion) but this time on what is unmistakeably a Leon Boll\u00e9e. I\u2019ve uploaded a copy of this photograph at:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75421485@N08/6928619249/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/75421485@N08/6928619249/in/photostream</a>\n\nOn this occasion Col. Dawson\u2019s passenger may well be the novelist Violet Martin. Can anyone confirm this?\n\nIncidently, if anyone is interested in viewing a Leon Boll\u00e9e and other early cars at least one hundred years old then they are very welcome to come to the start of the RIAC Pioneer Run which takes place on Sunday May 27th leaving from Barberstown Castle Hotel (near Maynooth) at 9.30am.
