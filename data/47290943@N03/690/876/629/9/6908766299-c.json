The RUC at that time did carry them and it was probably north of the border that you saw them.  The big debate on the specialist firearms units only took place since 2000 and the first units, who wear a more military style uniform with baseball cap were formed after 2002.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-6908766299-72157629065681840", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6908766299/#comment72157629066255220", "realname": "Norman", "path_alias": "normanicus_diabolicus", "author": "54884166@N04", "iconserver": "3814", "datecreate": "1329944481", "_content": "The man looking out from the window transforms this good image into a really great one!", "authorname": "Normanicus", "id": "47267889-6908766299-72157629066255220", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6908766299/#comment72157629077845982", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "65361386@N05", "iconserver": "6122", "datecreate": "1330079184", "_content": "To add to the evidence that this is a Luger, and to demonstrate that almost <i>anything</i> is available on the Web, here's a pic of the top of a Luger for comparison ...\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/65361386@N05/6779231150/]", "authorname": "vandillo", "id": "47267889-6908766299-72157629077845982", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6908766299/#comment72157629086322756", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1330178109", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/65361386@N05] Thanks for that!

Wrong place, those are Greek Street flats and back on to the Bridewell Yard, there was a very famous foundry in the space in between them up to the '80's.

The L shaped building is the Bridewell and the toe of the L creates a confined yard where the prison vans back in to disgorge the prisoners from the stations and the Prisons and later to collect them at the end of the Court day.  The Prison Sergeants office is approx 1/3rd along the leg of the bar of the L!  Incidentally the strange object in the second window was probably an exhibit for a case as that room was used for storage of the registers of prisoners, charge sheets and exhibits.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-6908766299-72157629108303282", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6908766299/#comment72157629112827386", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1330467946", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/starathena] Great!
