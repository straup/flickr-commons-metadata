So many clubs and societies sprang up here in Ireland (mainly affiliated to those of Britain) that promoted general fitness and 'the body beautiful' image. This was endorsed by governments especially after WW1 when they were shocked to discover how many people called up could not be accepted due to poor physical health. More well known though, is how the Nazis usurped the whole ethos elevating it to a form of national creed. \n\nI've quite a number of club badges associated with Physical Culture from this era, mainly from Britain. Here's one and probably the best known example [http://www.flickr.com/photos/23885771@N03/3929303669/in/set-72157615937292713/] \n\nThere were also Irish branches of the WHLB but unfortunately I don't have any of their badges as they are much rarer, harder to find and so expensive.\n\nPhysical Culture gained a boost in popularity after WW2 and through the 1950's, but it's general appeal waned after that.\n\nStuart.", "authorname": "RETRO STU", "id": "47267889-4929235072-72157625072854075", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/4929235072/#comment72157626776859169", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27779106@N02", "iconserver": "2873", "datecreate": "1307391102", "_content": "Great image!", "authorname": "doblecachanilla", "id": "47267889-4929235072-72157626776859169", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/4929235072/#comment72157627389932208", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66151649@N02", "iconserver": "6166", "datecreate": "1312855118", "_content": "Are they trying to spell something?
