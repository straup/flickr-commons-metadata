James T. Jameson, who ran the Irish Animated Picture Company at the Rotunda - and film/variety shows in many other towns around the country - seems to have moved his advertising away from the phrase &quot;Living Pictures,&quot; which was beginning to sound old fashioned, by early 1915.\nI'll add now that I don't think this can be 1911 based on the showtimes. The season of Rotunda Pictures that ran from 4 September-11 November 1911 - which included a film of the Unveiling of the Parnell Monument by the Thursday (7 Oct)  following the unveiling - had continuous performances and not advertised times (3, 6.45, 9) as we see in the photograph. When another picture season began at the Rotunda on 18 December (it would run until 30  March 1912), it did have advertised times, but these were 3, 7 and 9. This is a small difference from 3, 6.45 and 9, but it is significant because, as we can see, it would have involved complete redoing the signs at the front of the Rotunda. That change of signs came for a season that began in late December 1912. \nSo, I speculate (and only that) that we are looking at a photograph taken almost exactly a century ago in early 1913.", "authorname": "Denis Condon", "id": "47267889-8617836771-72157633356369698", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8617836771/#comment72157633341191695", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1366982997", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/denis-condon] Hello Denis, and very convincing speculation it is too!
