Sergeant Gillespie stated that on Sunday, the 17th July, at about twelve o'clock noon he was returning from Divine service and noticed several persons enter the back yard of the licensed premises. He went into the yard after them, and asked them to account for their presence. Some of the defendants walked away without replying, but other stated they were there in connection with salmon fishing. On inquiring from Mr. Patrick O'Doherty he found that statement to be false. ... [legal to-ing and fro-ing]\n\nMr. Scott [presiding]: Is it not a usual practice for persons of that locality to stop about the yard of Mrs. O'Doherty's premises on a Sunday - I won't say for the purpose of getting drink, but simply hanging around? \n\nSergeant Gillespie: I do not think so. If I saw them I would certainly prosecute.\n\nMr. Scott: Well, I have seen it myself. ...\n\nColonel Tynte, R.M.: Are you going to oppose the granting of a certificate to the publican, this being the sessions for the granting of certificates?\n\nSergeant Gillespie: No.\n\nIt was ultimately announced by the Chairman that the bench decided to impose a penalty of 1s. on each of the defendants.\n\nColonel Tynte, R.M.: If the publican does not put gates on the yard you can oppose the licence next sessions.\n\nMr. Marks, D.I.: Very well, your worship.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-11202920813-72157638346146854", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11202920813/#comment72157638346238634", "realname": "", "path_alias": "whatsthatpicture", "author": "24469639@N00", "iconserver": "3790", "datecreate": "1386158949", "_content": "Just had a quick look for Magnus on Ancestry and can find absolutely nothing.
