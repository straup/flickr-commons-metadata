The journey would take three months and the birds wore special leather boots to protect their feet. Geese wouldn't allow themselves to be shod (hence the phrase 'to shoe a goose' for something difficult) so had their feet dipped in tar and covered with sand. Pigs wore knitted boots with leather soles, and blacksmiths nailed metal plates on to the hooves of cattle. A flock of 1,000 turkeys could be managed by 2 drovers carrying long wands of willow or hazel with red cloth tied on the ends. Turkeys move at about one mile an hour - quicker than geese - but they insisted on roosting at night, so the whole journey took longer. Traffic jams were caused by the vast flocks entering London from East Anglia, Norfolk, and Suffolk in the weeks before Christmas. In America, turkey drives rivalled some of the cattle drives:<b> there are records of an 1863 drive from Iowa to Denver (600 miles) </b> and flocks of 20,000 were common. \n\nFrom <a href=\"http://old.qi.com/talk/viewtopic.php?start=8&amp;t=5504\" rel=\"nofollow\">old.qi.com/talk/viewtopic.php?start=8&amp;t=5504</a>\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06/11335484533/]\n\n<b> 20 Miles - with a cart and Donkey !!!!

I'm pretty sure it was based on a true story.\n\nHere we are, found it (but it was geese not turkeys, and it was a lorry drivers' strike, and it was nearer 30 years, but still):\n<blockquote>It was common practice to protect the birds feet by dipping them in tar and covering them with sand for their 100-mile trek which was completed at a brisk waddling pace of about 1 mile an hour. The epic nature of this goose run has become the stuff of legends and in 1984 a film called \u2018Singleton\u2019s Pluck\u2019 commemorated this remarkable journey by following a Norfolk farmer (Singleton, played by Ian Holm, who also played Bilbo in The Lord of The Rings) who was forced to take his geese to market in the traditional manner following a strike by truck drivers.\n\nThe film faithfully followed one of the old goose runs and the hero came through Western Suffolk with a gaggle of geese as noisy extras. Our photograph shows the geese passing through Clare market square headed by the actor Bill Owen (famous for his Compo character in Last of the Summer Wine) who was one of Singleton\u2019s farm hands.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.focuspublications.net/life/pages/GooseRun.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.focuspublications.net/life/pages/GooseRun.htm</a>\n\nAnd it was channel4, not BBC.\n\nTrailer at 3:28 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4g_VORPp_Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4g_VORPp_Q</a>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-11286372466-72157638602503625", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11286372466/#comment72157638602954555", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1386844685", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] Fantastic but will the Philistine (Carol) believe it???", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-11286372466-72157638602954555", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/11286372466/#comment72157638603195966", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1386845844", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] It'd take a Christmas Miracle to make a believer out of me!
