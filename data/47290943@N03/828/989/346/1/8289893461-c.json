He was descended from Cathair M\u00f3r, an earlier king of Leinster, who was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, also monarch of all Ireland around 200 AD. The clan's motto is the Latin phrase Certavi et vici, meaning &quot;I have fought and conquered&quot;.[1][2][3][4]\n \nIn pre-Norman times the O'Byrnes, then known as the U\u00ed F\u00e1el\u00e1in sept, inhabited the rich Kildare plains.
