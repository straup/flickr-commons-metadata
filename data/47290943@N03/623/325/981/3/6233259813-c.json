It was from this ship that Major-General Emmet Dalton successfully landed 456 men at Passage West on the 8th of August 1922. The TSS Arvonia( ex Cambria) plied between Dublin and Holyhead and was requisitioned from the London and North Western Railway Co.( L&amp;NWR) specifically for the southern troop landings.\nAnother ship, the TSS Lady Wicklow (requisitioned from the B &amp; I and also at Passage West), was used on the Fenit landing on the 2nd August.\nThe picture would date from late July/ early August 1922. I cannot see why it wouldn't have been taken on the voyage to Cork as the ship had only just been commandeered and also Hogan was in Passage West to see the troops disembark. He had to have been on board for the whole journey South. There are other photographs in the Hogan collection that support this and confirm that this one was taken aboard the Arvonia.
