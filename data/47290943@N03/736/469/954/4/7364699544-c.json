The vessels are not named in the exchange, but the following day The Times (London) said that Lloyd's had posted them as missing, and that they were the two ships referred to in parliament (the Coningbeg is the one which sailed on the 17th)\n\n<i><b>Mr. HOUSTON</b> asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he has any information as to the loss of a steamer which sailed from Liverpool on or about 15th December for Waterford and the loss of a steamer which sailed from Waterford on or about 17th December for Liverpool, together with the loss of all lives on board both ships; whether these vessels were escorted or in any way protected by the Admiralty; if so, what was the nature and description of the protection; and will he state the total number of lives lost on both vessels?\n<b>Dr. MACNAMARA</b> We have no information respecting the loss of these ships, except this, that one of the boats and part of another of the boats of one of the ships in question have been washed ashore. My hon. Friend is probably aware that the weather about that time off that coast was very bad. The vessels were not under escort. We have no information as to the numbers forming the crews of these vessels.\n<b>Mr. HOUSTON</b> Do not you know the number of lives lost? Cannot you communicate with the owners and make inquiries?\n<b>Dr. MACNAMARA</b> No; I can make inquiries, as my hon. Friend can.\n<b>Mr. HOUSTON</b> I know them.\n<b>Mr. HOGGE </b>May I ask whether it is a fact that a large number of children were lost by the sinking of these vessels?\n<b>Dr. MACNAMARA</b> No; I cannot say. I should require notice of that question.</i>\n\nIn June 1919 there was a court case (reported in the London Times) between two insurance companies. One had covered the vessels against normal risks, the other against war risks. It was a question of whether the losses were due to weather or  enemy action - it was known that German submarines were active in the Irish Sea. Although there was a possibility that the Formby's loss was due to the storm, the weather was much better when the Coningbeg sailed, and the judgment was that both vessels were sunk due to submarine action, and that the case went against the company covering war risks.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-7364699544-72157630048133047", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7364699544/#comment72157630048276271", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1339497368", "_content": "I think the photo is taken looking North from Adelphi Quay in Waterford (<a href=\"https://maps.google.ie/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=52.260065,-7.103639&amp;spn=0.00132,0.006706&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.260065,-7.103639&amp;panoid=VczkfHTJgSQ6aFae4LvRtg&amp;cbp=11,355.95,,0,-1.94\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetview</a>).
