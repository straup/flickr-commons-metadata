All the other hotels he/she stayed at are named, but frustratingly not the one at Kilkee.\n\n<blockquote><i>From Killarney we went to Kilkee. I suppose the dirtect distance is something like 50 miles, and we were ten hours on the way, owing to the Shannon route not being open. I am not sorry to have seen Kilkee, though it is a melancholy place. the cliffs are fine; the Atlantic is magnificent there - absolutely unsurpassed in my experience; the bathing is perfect;  the air sweet and bracing. Kilkee must always command a summer crowd; but its properity is on the wane, I fancy. Lahinch is the place to stay in Clare. From it you can visit Lisdoonvarna, the Cliffs of Moher, and Kilkee, and, beside its golf links, it has a clean-looking hotel of which everyone spoke well. Kilkee, on the other hand gave <b>the primest samples of melancholy slatternliness</b>, combined with high prices, that we found. We went to the hotel that had been recommended to us as the best. It was late at night when we arrived, and we had fed in the train, so that all I wanted was a drink of milk. I asked for a pint boiled, and got it in a pint jug. The price charged for that milk was two shillings. If you didn't trip up in the dining room, by catching your foot in rents in the carpet a foot long, you might make your way to the drawing room after dinner, sit on a cane-bottomed chair with a hole in it through which you could thrust your fist, and drink coffee at a shilling a small cup. The sea is surpassingly lovely at Kilkee, but it is a relief to think that I shall never go there ahgain till it has a hotel of the kind one finds in Connemara.</i></blockquote>\n\nEdit: from <a href=\"http://www.kilkee.ie/about_history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.kilkee.ie/about_history.html</a>. Plenty of hotels to choose from\n<blockquote>The first hotel in Kilkee was Sampy's Hotel in Francis Street (now Grattan St). Other Hotels developed in the late 19th century included Moore's Hotel, West End Hotel, Blundell's Hotel, Atlantic Hotel, Browne's Hotel, Royal Marina Hotel and the Stella Maris Hotel.</blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-7368081294-72157630118183230", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7368081294/#comment72157630118190344", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1339582028", "_content": "<i>Mr Chavalier's advertisement in the Limerick Chronicle, was placed beside another one for Michael Kent's shop in Kilkee (beside the Stella Maris Hotel) which boasted that he had been in business for thirteen years and that his celebrated pies and Bewley's mineral waters were available to tourists and visitors.
