Complementing this legacy, the town once boasted a large manufacturing industry with activity concentrated at either end of the town: the Selskar Iron Works (established 1897) in the north of the town with the Star Ironworks (opened 1882) off Trinity Street and the Folly Mills Iron Works and Agricultural Machinery and Implement Factory, or Pierce Ironworks Foundry, at the meeting of Distillery Road with Mill Road in the south of the town. Having been established in 1839 by James Pierce (1813-68), the Pierce Ironworks Foundry was subsequently developed by the Pierce brothers Philip (1850-95), Martin (d. 1907) and John (d. 1926) to such an extent that at one time the complex represented the largest engineering or agricultural machinery manufacturer in the country with offices located in Paris and Buenos Aires. However, commercial success was interrupted in August 1911 during the infamous &quot;Lock-Out&quot; when the Pierces sought to prevent workers from joining the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU): soon all of the foundries in the town had followed suit leading to a series of pickets and protests which were not resolved until February of the following year. Although the last vestiges of the complex (between 1868-1903) have recently (2006-7) been cleared to make way for the redevelopment of the site, the legacy of the foundry prevails in the output of, and the numerous off-shoot developments sponsored by the Pierces in the late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth centuries. For instance, the cast-iron railings (between 1862-80) embellishing the perimeter of the &quot;twin churches&quot; were supplied and maintained for one hundred years by the company. Meanwhile, a housing scheme was established at Avenue de Flandres (1939), Mulgannon Road, for senior managers with a later scheme (1947) at Casa Rio, Distillery Road, intended for middle management: a contemporary scheme at Alvina Brook (1946) similarly bears a named derived from or inspired by the location of the Pierce offices around the globe. A comparatively short-lived venture, the Pierce Plough Foundry or Pierce Bicycle Works, operated between 1903-41 on the site of the earlier Bishop.s Water Distillery complex (opened 1827): the entrance on to the grounds survives to the present day in the form of a commanding Classical-style gate screen. Manifesting, in physical form, the success of the foundry and the resulting financial rewards, the Pierce family seat, Park House (c.1750), originally Ballyboggan House, Ballyboggan in the north of the town forms the centrepiece of a middle-size suburban estate embellished with artefacts salvaged from the Castleboro House estate (relocated between 1923-32), further structures (1868 and 1907) commemorating various members of the family, and, in a reflection of the paranoia stemming from &quot;The Emergency&quot; (1939-45), a mass-concrete air raid shelter (1940).
