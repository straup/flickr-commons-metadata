Instead of having only the common door for entrance and exit, every department has a special means of communication with the street, and to a great extent is independent of that which adjoins it\u2014an arrangement of no .light importance in the case of fire.</i>\n\n#69: Was indeed Allen's drapery and tailors shop. A location it occupied through to the 20th century. (My own grandmother set-up her ladies tailoring business in a rented space on the other side of the street. In Burton's buildings. Above Gerald Goldberg's legal offices)\n\nCHURCH: St Peter and Paul's is indeed RC, and also notable to history nerds as being a good genealogical records source.
