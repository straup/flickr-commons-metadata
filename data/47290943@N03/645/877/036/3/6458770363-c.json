The fliers received a huge  welcome here, doing social rounds and meeting the de Valera led Cabinet. Up to 15 mechanics had to fashion parts from  scrap metal to repair the under-carriage and it was two weeks before the plane took from Moy. Alas, they came down again, this time in Wales, when the engine failed. Another two weeks passed before the 'Mona Lisa' was repaired again. Commodore Pond, who was now  at the end of his tether, made  the sensational claim that their plane had been vandalised! It is now known if they got that national welcome promised by Mussolini. Incidentally, Lieut. Sabelli sported the Italian Facist badge. - D.
