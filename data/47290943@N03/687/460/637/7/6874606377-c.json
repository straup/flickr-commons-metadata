Arthur Bretland was the chief mechanical engineer of the MGWR up to 1925, who invented one of if not the world's first automatic railway tracklaying machine and the above gantry connected to it's operation.\n\n (Here's his 1925 dated patent <a href=\"http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1547019.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.freepatentsonline.com/1547019.pdf</a> ) \n\nThe gantry here enabled pre-assembled track panels to be hoisted on to flatcars of his Bretland tracklayer for delivery to the intended relaying site. The gantry was electrically operated, 65ft high and 500ft long. Mullingar was chosen because of it's central point on the MGWR system. The machine and the plant were largely unused together after amalgamation of the railways into GSR in 1925, because of it's in inability to deal with staggered rail joints which predominated over the rest of the non MGWR built rail network, \n\nThe extensive sidings were then used to store scrapped loco's and stock as JP photographed here in the early 60's.
