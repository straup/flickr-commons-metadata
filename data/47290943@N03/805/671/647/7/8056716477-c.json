But these approaches have all been remedied, pricipally at the expense of the merchants, as well as a new one (Mulgrave-road) constructed at a very large cost. Within the present year a sum of 4,000l. is being expended in enlarging and beautifying the market; a commercial room, reading room, committee and other offices, being added to it, as well as a beautiful pillared entance erected in front of Mulgrave-road.</i></blockquote>\n\nAnd from a lengthy statement from the Cork Committee of merchants respecting the Cork butter market, concerning the operation of the market, published in Freeman's Nov 29th 1852\n<blockquote><i>The committee provide four inspectors, or tasters of butter, men of general intelligence, unexceptionable character, and matured knowledge of this article and its distinctive qualities, whose whole time is required to be devoted to the business of the committee, to the exclusion of any other pusuit or employment whatever. These officers receive a salary of 150l. per annum.</i></blockquote>\n\nI quite fancy the job of butter inspector, but before I apply, do I have to provide my own toast and marmite to go with it?
