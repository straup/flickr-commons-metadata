Everyone was expecting a big celebration. However, at the same time, the Ulster Revival was happening in Coleraine.  It attracted thousands to the town.   Many people were overcome by the experience of their conversion. Shelter had to be found whilst they were being looked after. There was nowhere else in the town to go so they were brought to the newly completed Town Hall. The Ministers at the time expressed their thanks by donating the Revival Bible to Corporation of Coleraine. The official opening did not take place until 2009 -150 years late!\n</blockquote>\nFrom - <a href=\"http://www.niarchive.org/directory/uploads/8872c70b-e26a-47d5-8d9d-7c1180106d61/Victorian Coleraine ST08.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.niarchive.org/directory/uploads/8872c70b-e26a-47d5-8d...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-9265719553-72157634600708289", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9265719553/#comment72157634600752733", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1373619698", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] That delayed official opening is one for the Guinness Book of Records!", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9265719553-72157634600752733", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9265719553/#comment72157634608402758", "realname": "", "path_alias": "johnspooner", "author": "29809546@N00", "iconserver": "8104", "datecreate": "1373628478", "_content": "The scenes in the town hall in 1859 as reported by the Coleraine Chronicle, and reprinted by the Belfast News-letter on June 20, 1859.\n\n<blockquote>The new Town-hall, the mode of celebrating the completion of which had, a few weeks ago, given no little anxiety to our more public spirited townsmen, was opened in a most unexpected and still more gratifying way than could have been anticipated. Instead of the joyous dance and the stirring and enlivening music of the ball-room, which, with all its glitter, could not have satisfied the heart of any of those who might in the evanescent enjoyment of the have delighted, the walls of the hall gave back the almost despairing groan of a stricken sinner, the heartfelt prayer of a believing penitent, or resounded with the adoring thanks of a redeemed saint. Incessant watching and labour had, towards an advanced hour of the morning, thinned the room of the band of comforters which up till then had been indefatigable in their attempts at consolatiom; but to us who visited it a t intervalsduring the night from twelve o'clock, the scene was indescribable. A melancholy beauty attached to it which was saddening and beautiful in the extreme - saddening because in more than one instance, we saw a struggling soul battling for a victory over Satan without a solitary individual to speal comfort - and beautiful because we felt confidence in the result, beliving that God &quot;who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb&quot; would, in His own good time, bring relief through the peace-speaking blood of the Atonement.</blockquote>\netc etc\n\nIncidentally, I put the quoted text into a Readability index calculator.
