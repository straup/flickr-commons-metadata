This force, consisting of 400 Free State soldiers, one field gun and an armoured car under Christopher O'Malley, re-took the Republican held town of Westport and linked up with another Free State column under Sean MacEoin advancing from Castlebar. A Free State column also dispersed anti-Treaty IRA forces in Donegal in Ireland's north-west.\nThe largest seaborne landings took place in the south. Ships disembarked about 2,000 well equipped Free State troops into the heart of the &quot;Munster Republic&quot; and caused the rapid collapse of the Republican position in this province.\nPaddy Daly and the Dublin Guard landed at Fenit in County Kerry on 31 July and fought their way into Tralee at the cost of 9 killed and 35 wounded. They were reinforced on 3 August, by around 250 pro-treaty IRA men from County Clare, embarked from Kilrush to Tarbert in fishing boats. The Free State forces rapidly occupied the towns in the county but the Republican units in Kerry survived more or less intact and would fight a determined guerrilla campaign for the remainder of the war.\nIf the Munster Republic had a capital, it was Cork and the largest seaborne landings of the civil war were aimed at taking that city. Emmet Dalton led 800 troops, with two artillery pieces and armoured cars, who landed at Passage West, near the city, on 8 August. A further 200 men were put ashore at Youghal and 180 troops landed at Glandore. After some fighting at Rochestown in which 9 Free State and 7 Republican fighters were killed, the badly armed anti-treaty IRA in Cork did not try to resist this offensive but burned Charles Barracks, near Kinsale, which they were holding, and dispersed.\nOn 10 August, Cork city was retaken, the last city to fall in the &quot;Munster Republic&quot;. Liam Lynch, the Republican commander in chief abandoned Fermoy, the last Republican held town, the following day. In leaving Fermoy, he issued an order to troops under his command to stop trying to hold fixed positions and to form flying columns to pursue guerrilla warfare.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887933678", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632887953896", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1362129520", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06] Looking at the pictures on clydesite, it could easily be either of them.", "authorname": "derangedlemur", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887953896", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632887963220", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1362129676", "_content": "Ship could be the arvonia  see\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=928&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=1922+arvonia+ship&amp;oq=1922+arvonia+ship&amp;gs_l=img.3...7368.13556.0.13752.10.5.0.5.0.0.41.165.5.5.0...0.0...1ac.1.5.img.vkwpXPvHVeo#biv=i|0;d|c0TcBYRQlPi-6M:\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari...</a>\n\nStupid IPad .....", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887963220", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632887978952", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1362129923", "_content": "What might the text behind the squeeze-box player say?\n\nFour Courts?\n\nIt's not a big ship, we're looking at half the width of the deck here, given that the wheel at top right is on the centre line.", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887978952", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632887984580", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1362130016", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnmcauley] Definitely <b>Four Courts</b> - one of the very famous armoured cars involved in the Civil War...", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887984580", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632887999402", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1362130215", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79549245@N06]  We've seen the fighting in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6652701421/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Passage West</b></a> on 8/9 August 1922...", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632887999402", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632888038264", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1362130825", "_content": "Too small for the <a href=\"http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/LMS_LNWR1.html#anchor1120774\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arvonia</a>, I think.", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632888038264", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632883784889", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1362130950", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.mariner.ie/history/articles/war/early-navy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Early Irish Free State Naval Activity</a>\n\nOn 7-8-1922 the Arvonia and the Lady Wicklow commandeered steam packets from the LNWR and B&amp;I landed troops from Dublin at Passage west. <b>An armoured car was landed at Passage west.</b>", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-8517245863-72157632883784889", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8517245863/#comment72157632888047038", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1362130975", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] It says Four Courts but it's not the armoured car.
