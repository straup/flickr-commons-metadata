They pinned the soldiers down and eventually the troops had to work their way down from house to house to get close enough to engage the rebels from cover.  Legend has it that on the way they executed some local men who were trapped in their houses by the crossfire.

It backed onto the park of the Kings Inns and there was also an entrance at Coleraine House at the top of Coleraine St.  This meant that any positions there were very vulnerable to being outflanked.  The decision to burn it probably rendered it unusable for a few days at least given its size and gave the rebels a certain amount of cover for their barricades at Church St - Nth King St.  I always understood that some reserve cavalry who had assembled at Linenhall had come under fire and had to withdraw hastily but I cannot find any reference to that at the moment and from the census returns it seems unlikely?", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632169761972", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632165469053", "realname": "Paul Clerkin", "path_alias": "archiseek", "author": "7922758@N06", "iconserver": "8156", "datecreate": "1354623426", "_content": "Illustrations of it back in its heyday\n<a href=\"http://archiseek.com/2011/1728-linen-hall-yarnhall-st-dublin/#.UL3piYOunps\" rel=\"nofollow\">archiseek.com/2011/1728-linen-hall-yarnhall-st-dublin/#.U...</a>", "authorname": "archiseek", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632165469053", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632165486611", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1354623652", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/archiseek] It was impressive wasn't it?", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632165486611", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632170373500", "realname": "", "path_alias": "lizinitaly", "author": "34305619@N06", "iconserver": "5539", "datecreate": "1354630110", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/archiseek] thanks for that link!", "authorname": "Wendy:", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632170373500", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632166734687", "realname": "Paul Clerkin", "path_alias": "archiseek", "author": "7922758@N06", "iconserver": "8156", "datecreate": "1354635968", "_content": "Well, it was a major public building for a time.", "authorname": "archiseek", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632166734687", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632171623334", "realname": "Colleen", "path_alias": "colleenamareena", "author": "53686581@N05", "iconserver": "8231", "datecreate": "1354641330", "_content": "As an American whose only education of Irish history was the Great Potato Famine, could someone give a brief overview of the rebellion?

The garrison, which numbered some forty unarmed men of the Army Pay Corps were summoned to surrender, but refused. Gelignite was placed in position in the wall facing Lurgan Street, and the barracks\u2019 door was burst open with sledge hammers. The garrison then surrendered.\nAt the Bridewell a number of armed policemen, found in the cellars, were disarmed and brought into the Four Courts. At 3 p.m., Linenhall Barracks was set on fire to prevent its reoccupation by the encircling forces, and in the course of the day the blaze assumed large proportions.\nDuring Wednesday night it lighted up the streets with a murky glow. By Thursday it had travelled to Messrs. Moore\u2019s, the druggists, in Bolton Street, and then became really spectacular. Large barrels of oil were tossed into the air and exploded, and a cloud of stifling smoke shrouded the district.\nAttempts were made to confine the fire by hosing, and these were partially successful.\nEven on Thursday night, the blaze made the streets bright as day, but by Friday it had subsided, and pitch darkness once more reigned at night. The remaining tenements\nin North King Street were hastily evacuated except by those whose grim business it was to stay there and fight to the death. \nShops were hastily barricaded with corrugated iron and planking.\n\n...Dinny O\u2019Callaghan...was operating in the area and was responsible for the taking over and destruction of Linenhall Barracks. </i>", "authorname": "DaithiDePaor", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632479176118", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632488915210", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1357832317", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/71822085@N03] Thanks so much for adding that vivid description!\n\nThat 1966 issue is, unsurprisingly, the most requested of our run of the <i>Capuchin Annual</i>....", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632488915210", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632497320334", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92100893@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1357924506", "_content": "My mam's family have lived one of the houses that were built on the site of the Barracks...good to know the story behind it now :)", "authorname": "ancailinrua", "id": "47267889-8243049545-72157632497320334", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8243049545/#comment72157632494630231", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1357941799", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/92100893@N07] Thanks.
