Her tulle veil fell from a wreath of orange blossoms and pearls, and she carried a sheaf bouquet of lilies.\nTwo little girls - Miss Teresa D'Arcy and Miss Deirdre Grattan-Bellew - dressed in sprigged organdie, acted as trainbearers, while the grown-up bridesmaids were: The Misses Patricia and Linda Loftus, sisters of the bride; Miss P. Stanley, Miss D. Bromley, Miss B. Markes, and Miss B. M. Sharpe. Their charming frocks of pale pink organdie were relieved by turquoise and pink cir\u00e9 satin sashes. Wreaths of velvet rose petals to tone were worn on their heads, and they carried shower bouquets of pink roses, and wore coral and crystal necklets and buckle brooches, the gifts of the bridegroom.
