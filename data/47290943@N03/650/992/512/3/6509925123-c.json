The Foo Dog finial is often seen on lids. From the looks of it, I'm guessing it's late 19th century but the mark on the base would confirm or refute that. The better quality vases shows exquisite detail in the painting and the dog image is finely moulded with sharp detail and well painted. 'Cantonese' pottery is still exported from China worldwide but most of the modern examples lack that quality, although are still attractive decorative pieces.", "authorname": "RETRO STU", "id": "47267889-6509925123-72157628414225729", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6509925123/#comment72157628414419371", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "55597723@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1323860527", "_content": "Well taken.
