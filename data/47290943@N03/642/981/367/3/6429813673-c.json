Major Stephen Lushington is this man I believe,\n\n&quot;Stephen Lushington was born in January 1864 and was educated at Eton. Commissioned into the Royal Artillery in February 1884, he was advanced to Captain in January 1893 and to Major in February 1900. In the latter rank he acted as Inspector-General of Police, and as Commandant of Militia, in British Guiana from 1902-07, services that were rewarded by his appointment to C.M.G. in the latter year.\n\nThe advent of hostilities in August 1914 found Lushington serving as a Lieutenant-Colonel in 41st Brigade R.F.A., which unit he took to France and commanded at Villers-Cotteret on 1 September, when his batteries successfully covered the withdrawal of the 4th Guards Brigade, although \u2018under an infernal fire\u2019; 41st Brigade R.F.A. provided similar support to the 2nd Worcestershires at Polygon Wood at the end of the following month. Lushington was mentioned in despatches and created a C.B. (London Gazette 18 February 1915). From 1915 until 1919, he served on the R.A. Staff as a Temporary Brigadier-General and was three more times mentioned in despatches, in addition to being awarded the Italian Military Order of Savoy, 4th class.\nThe General died at Farnham, Surrey in December 1940, aged 76 years.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.dnw.co.uk/medals/auctionarchive/searchcataloguearchive/itemdetail.lasso?itemid=40830\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dnw.co.uk/medals/auctionarchive/searchcataloguearchiv...</a>", "authorname": "ofarrl", "id": "47267889-6429813673-72157629535317475", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6429813673/#comment72157629171067842", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1331157352", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/33577523@N08] Fantastic, thank you!
