He was a member of an excursion party from Londonderry Methodist City Mission, and in the absence of the attendant at dinner hour he went, with others, to bathe at the outer side of the pier, when a strong current was running. The pier was deserted, as the majority of people had assembled at the opposite side of the harbour to witness the arrival of the Laird Line steamer Hazel <b>on her maiden voyage</b>. As the steamer was being moored the cry was raised that a boy had gone down. A boat was quickly launched, and was only in time to pick up a young man named Thomas Davis, of Derry, who had accompanied Young into the water, and who, in attempting to save his life, almost lost his own. Young's body was recovered half an hour later, and efforts made to restore animation by Doctors Martin and Porter, with the assistance of the coastguards, were of no avail.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-8199886490-72157632051243896", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8199886490/#comment72157632051312342", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1353342302", "_content": "Hmm, the original image for [http://www.flickr.com/photos/8468254@N02]'s postcard is in the nli archive, and the backwards writing on it says <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000318725/Image?lookfor=http://www.nli.ie/glassplates/L_ROY/L_ROY_09209.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">&quot;Glasgow Steamer The harbour Portrush&quot;</a>.\n\nIs it the same ship?
