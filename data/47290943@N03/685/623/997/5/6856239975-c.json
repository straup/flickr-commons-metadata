The Sheffield &amp; Rotherham Independent, Saturday, June 03, 1899\n<blockquote>Mr McKeown (the hotel proprietor) offered this morning to drive us to a funeral of the mother of one of his men. We drove up into the bare wild hill-land known as &quot;Joyce's Country,&quot; and there joined a long procession of cars, and people afoot, until at last we wound aside into a little upland vale, in the bottom of which was a small walled spinney. No building was near, except a few scattered farms and cabins on the slopes of the big hills that closely sheltered this quiet little copse. There the relatives began themselves to dig her grave among the trees, in earth that was little but stones, while most of the men and women in the procession spread themselves out in groups, all over the ground around their on dead. Round a dozen graves, <b>marked only by a little pile of stones</b>, were as many groups of kneeling relatives, the women burying their heads in their shawls, rocking themselves to and fro, and wailing - &quot;keening&quot; - in shrill plaintive cadences. Such a scene in such a place brought one very close indeed to Mother Earth.<blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-6856239975-72157636861969495", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6856239975"}}
