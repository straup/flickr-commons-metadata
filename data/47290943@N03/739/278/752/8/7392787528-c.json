They carried bouquets of pink carnations and wore pearl and turquoise pendants, the gifts of the bridegroom.

She died in 1911, and of the four sons of the marriage only the youngest, Lieutenant-Colonel Hubert Rowan Atkinson, survives. The eldest, Edward Chute, died in 1906; the third, Captain Hector John Anderson, died in 1917; and the second, Cecil Thomas, a Judge of the High Court at Patna, was killed on the railway in India in 1919. </i></blockquote>\n\nSo back to 1919. A brief note on 22nd November states\n<blockquote><i>Lord Atkinson, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, received yesterday news from the India Office that his elder son, Mr Cecil Thomas Atkinson KC, an Indian Judge, had been killed in a railway accident in India while on his way from Bombay to Patna.</i></blockquote>\n\nAnd on 28th November a bit more detail:\n<blockquote><i>INDIAN JUDGE'S DEATH\n\nALLAHABAD Nov 19 (delayed) - The body of Mr Justice Atkinson, of the Patna High Court, has been found on a railway line at Sutna.\n\nIt appears that the judge was travelling to Bankipur, a suburb of Patna. The guard noticed on the journey that the door of a lavatory was open, and on a search being made the body was discovered. The funeral took place here yesterday afternoon. Mr Justice Atkinson only arrived from England last week.</i></blockquote>\n\nSo did he fall out of the train? We need an expert on the layout of  railway carriages in West Bengal 1910-1920.\n\nAs for  'A Passage to India', according to the wikipedia entry for Bankipore/Bankipur \n<i>It is believed that E. M.

On that day the Hon\u2019ble Judges wore full court dress. They were robed in red gowns, wigs, black knee breeches, black silk stockings and buckled patent leather shoes. Exactly at 10.35 the Judges entered the Chief Justice\u2019s Court room and took their seats on red morocco stuffed armless chairs on the dais. The Registrar of the Court, the Commissioner of the Division, the Commissioner of Excise and Registration and some local high officials took their seat on the dais behind the Judges. The Judges were welcomed on behalf of the Bar by Maulana Mazharul Haq, Barrister-at-Law.</i></blockquote>\n\nI can't imagine that such an auspicious occasion was allowed to pass without it being recorded for posterity by the Patna equivalent of A.H.
