The news of peace took Dublin by surprise. It was, of course, expected, but hardly so soon, and it was proclaimed by the newsboys to streets, which, on account of the heavy rain, were all but wholly deserted. At about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon the Lord Mayor received the news in a telegram from the Secretary of State for War. At about half-past 6 the news was in the different newspaper offices, but it was not until half-past 8 o'clock that special editions were issued. In spite of the rain the streets became full, though never at any time crowded, so soon as the news had time to circulate. In one or two churches where the news was received just before the close of the service the choirs, with no other impulse than their own, immediately sang the National Anthem, but the hour was too late and the weather too unpropitious for any general public demonstration. There can be no doubt, however, that in Dublin the news has been received with heartfelt relief and gratitude. The undergraduates of Trinity College celebrated with an immense fire in one of the quadrangles. <b>The particulars of the terms of peace are everywhere patiently awaited.</b> In loyal circles and, perhaps, in some Nationalist ones it is anxiously hoped that the terms, while showing generosity to the conquered, will exhibit no weakness on behalf of the conquerers.</blockquote>", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637869906216", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637869914256", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384946646", "_content": "I think it's deffo Tuesday 3rd June.

Sturrock &amp; Sons, Buchanan Street, a turbine water engine, which acts as the motive power for their rotary hair-brushing machine, and which, we believe, is the first and only one erected in Glasgow. Inside this apparatus is fixed a little wheel, which, in its formation and action somewhat resembles the paddle of a steamer. Being furrowed with numerous little grooves, it necessarily revolves when the water, supplied from the main in the street, comes in contact with these, and the movement thus produced sets the rest of the machinery in motion. From a shaft which stretches from one end of the saloon to the other, long bands, apparently of india-rubber, are suspended, and to these the hair-brushing apparatus (which, by the way, is so arranged as to revolve when the turbine wheel is set in motion) can easily be attached, when any gentleman is desirous of trying its effect on his hair, whiskers, or moustache. The sensation produced when the hair is thus brushed is by no means unpleasant or disagreeable, indeed if anything it is rather the reverse; and any person who is annoyed with locks so obstinate and unyielding as never to admit of being properly unravelled by the ordinary comb and brush, should not fail to subject them to this new operation. As may be supposed, some time and trouble have been expended in procuring and fitting up this contrivance, and we believe the cost of the whole affair has been considerable. Tha apparatus has excited a good deal of curiosity.</blockquote>\n\nSounds like a solution to the bad hair day, but I think I'll stick with a comb.\n\nThe Morning Post, Tuesday, July 10, 1866 announced that \n<blockquote>The greatest novelty of the season is undoubtedly the new mechanical hair brush for ladies, lately introduced by Messrs. Unwin and Albert, Court hairdressers, 24, Picadilly. The success of machinery for brushing gentlemen's hair having been so great, Messrs. Unwin and Albert were induced to give their attention to the production of an equally successful arrangement for ladies.</blockquote>\n\nAn article in The Morning Post, Monday, December 13, 1875 entitled &quot;Unhealthy Occupations&quot; includes the line \n<blockquote>The modern system of hair brushing by machinery was most injurious to the operators, and several cases had occurred in which the hairdresser had been compelled to leave his business owing to a complaint produced by the inhalation during the process of particles of fine dust and fragments of hair.</blockquote> Uuuurgh.\n\nIn an article about &quot;Electro-motors for small workshops&quot; on Sep 9th 1892, The Huddersfield Examiner predicted that they would mean that &quot;hair-brushing by machinery will receive a fresh impetus&quot;.\n\nA letter to The Standard on July 19th 1887, from G. H. Wheeler, President of British Trichological Association asserts that &quot;Hair-brushing machinery, I am sure, is responsible for hundreds of bald heads&quot;.\n\nIt was evidently still in use in Newry in 1902. I wonder when and why hair brushing by machinery died out.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637872488254", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637872500334", "realname": "Ben Fagan", "path_alias": null, "author": "99002941@N08", "iconserver": "5550", "datecreate": "1384952479", "_content": "Was searching for that but couldn't find it for some reason.", "authorname": "Robinson_Luzo", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637872500334", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637872674904", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384952921", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] First time I've wished for bad weather, John, but if it keeps you inside and finding gems like these...  :D", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637872674904", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637872990793", "realname": "", "path_alias": "johnspooner", "author": "29809546@N00", "iconserver": "8104", "datecreate": "1384953283", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Surely the NLI has a late 19th century photo of the interior of a Dublin barber's shop, complete with the latest equipment?", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637872990793", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637872328745", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1384953883", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Down/South_Ward_Newry/Hill_Street__Part_of/1248077/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matthew McCourt</a>, Boot and Shoe Manufacturer", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637872328745", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637874736015", "realname": "John Sanders", "path_alias": null, "author": "48236157@N02", "iconserver": "8442", "datecreate": "1384959330", "_content": "idyllic!", "authorname": "TEXASJOHN", "id": "47267889-10958329045-72157637874736015", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10958329045/#comment72157637879021424", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384966940", "_content": "Really happy now about Tuesday, 3rd June date.
