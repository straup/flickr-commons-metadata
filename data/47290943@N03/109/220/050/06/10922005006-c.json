He started to build bikes in a small premises on South King Street in Dublin. 99% of bikes at that stage were imported. O'Neill started by importing the parts and assembling on South King Street. Quality was so good that he took the adjoining shop in 1906 &quot;and the present fine premises in South King street built, the works in connection with which were installed with a complete plant for the manufacture of cycle parts.&quot;\n\nAt this stage, John O'Neill went into manufacturing <b>Lucania</b> bicycles, which apparently had a great reputation for quality. Orders went through the roof. &quot;In 1911, it may here be stated, Mr. O'Neill secured the contract in open competition with the leading English manufacturers for 400 machines for the G.P.O. delivery service, and last year [1912] he received an order for a further 400 cycles from the Postmaster-General.&quot;\n\nIn 1907, O'Neill took over Irish Plating and Enamelling on Great Brunswick (now Pearse) Street. In 1912, O'Neill opened &quot;the extensive factory in Pleasants street, the formal opening being performed by His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant, who, in the course of an interesting address, warmly congratulated Mr. O'Neill on his energy and enterprise, and on the steadily growing prosperity of the industry...&quot;\n\nI've had a look at the photo of the new Pleasants Street factory in the <i>Weekly Irish Times</i>.

The 'improvement' consists of a piece of basket-work, which can be easily and quickly attached to any bicycle below the saddle by silvered fittings, and makes the lady appear to be sitting comfortably in an arm-chair, and does away with the use of an additional skirt, or change of dress, whilst the mounting and dismounting are not in the slightest degree interfered with.   A compartment in the basket-chair is for the reception of small articles, such as gloves, toilet requisites, &amp;c, &amp;c. We hope that the present ugly and abrupt appearance of lady cyclists will soon be a dream of the past, and instead we will admire the aesthetic lines of the new invention. The invention can be ornamented in various designs, and is sure to meet with the approval of all. ... ... </i>\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "47267889-10922005006-72157637797206036", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10922005006/#comment72157637797298106", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384770228", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] That writer would have had caniptions if he'd(?) ever encountered back views of ladies clad in lycra!", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-10922005006-72157637797298106", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10922005006/#comment72157637797182145", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384770494", "_content": "Also from the <i>Weekly Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 5 April 1913...\n\nO'Neill's Bicyles were sold into China, West Africa, Portugal, India, New Zealand, America (North and South).\n\nThe enthusiastic journalist wrote:\n<blockquote>It is interesting to note that at the long distance cycle race at the Olympic Games in Stockholm [1912] the only team all of whose members finished was the Irish team, two-thirds of whom were mounted on Lucania cycles.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-10922005006-72157637797182145", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10922005006/#comment72157637798294764", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91549360@N03", "iconserver": "2827", "datecreate": "1384771545", "_content": "It was called the LUCANIA CYCLE FACTORY....The Pleasants Street premises was built in 1911.
