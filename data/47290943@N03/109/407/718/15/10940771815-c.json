During recent sumers the lack of water has been felt severely in the neighbourhood of Dublin. In certain areas of the city it has been necessary at times to cut off supplies during certain hours, and in the rural and suburban areas there has been genuine distress.</blockquote>\n\nThe article adds that the lack of a reliable water supply meant that all housing development in the adjoining county and boroughs had come &quot;to a sudden and undesirable stop&quot;.", "authorname": "John Spooner", "id": "47267889-10940771815-72157637842059665", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10940771815/#comment72157637844533513", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1384877820", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnspooner] And in the <i>Irish Times</i> September 1938, they called it the Griffth-Kettle-Moynihan Scheme!
