[<b>Tuesday 30 July</b>] Matters were more lively in the city to-day owing to another outburst of activity on the part of the pickets. Vans were held up in different parts of the city, the most flagrant case being, perhaps, that which occurred in <b>Great George's street</b>. Two lorries proceeding from the Midland Railway Terminus to Messrs. David Allen and Sons' printing establishment in Corporation street were stopped and overturned, the contents of one being scattered over the street. Shortly afterwards a spring van was stopped and the goods removed, but on the arrival of police from Henry street Barracks they were replaced, and the van resumed its journey under escort. In Royal Avenue a number of vehicles were turned, and in the vicinity of Smithfield and the Great Northern Railway goods yard pickets were to be seen at every street corner.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9212218785-72157634496981660", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9212218785/#comment72157634497040836", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1373026017", "_content": "I spotted this flyer the other day in a new batch of digitised items we've put online, and as [http://www.flickr.com/photos/91549360@N03] mentioned above here's further evidence of a  <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000047490\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>James Larkin connection</b></a> with this Belfast Dock Strike.", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9212218785-72157634497040836", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "9212218785"}}
