Brendan Grogan in Waterford (a relative) spotted Bay Farrell in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5841413289/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>this photo</b></a> taken at a Bazaar in Tramore on Thursday, 17 June 1909!\n\nAlways delighted to hear from relatives, but especially so in this case as Miss Farrell was on my list for upload as this photo is so crazy. Don't think Bay Farrell's relatives will mind me saying that, as Brendan himself said: <i>She was described by an Irish relative as being &quot;high spirited&quot; and had been known to go out &quot;without her gloves.&quot;</i>\n\nHere's the information submitted by Brendan under the photo where he spotted Bay, who must have been back from the States for a visit in 1909:\n&quot;<i>... was Margaret Mary Farrell, known as 'Bay'. She was baptized on October 19,1874 at Sacred Heart, Ferrybank, Waterford. She was one of 11 children born to Richard Farrell and Mary Monica (Downey), amongst whom was my Grandfather, Walter J. Farrell. Austin Farrell, (NLI Ref.: P_WP_3697) was another brother.\n\nShe was described by an Irish relative as being &quot;high spirited&quot; and had been known to go out &quot;without her gloves.&quot; She moved to the United States and married Jeremiah Carew, who she knew from Waterford, at Fort Myer, Alexandria, Virginia in 1899. She died October 30, 1942 (aged 68) in Bronx, New York.</i>&quot;\n\nSo what do we think Miss Bay Farrell is up to here? Wonder if it was taken in or near the Barracks in Waterford? (Definitely taken in Waterford)\n\nDate: 1894?\n\nNLI Ref.: <a href=\"http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/P_WP_0599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">P_WP_0599</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5808", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1894-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1377643936", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1341821273"}, "originalsecret": "6d4673183c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "Good Irish whiskey from Locke's Distillery I hope?", "author": "39191857@N05", "h": "26", "authorname": "swordscookie", "w": "28", "y": "170", "x": "133", "id": "72157630492744356"}, {"_content": "Unusual chimney stack at 45 degrees", "author": "14302637@N08", "h": "41", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "w": "33", "y": "12", "x": "169", "id": "72157630495211676"}, {"_content": "Dead or drunk?", "author": "38401430@N06", "h": "76", "authorname": "billh35", "w": "181", "y": "345", "x": "2", "id": "72157630500114602"}, {"_content": "Old horses don't die.\nThey just fade away.", "author": "14302637@N08", "h": "134", "authorname": "blackpoolbeach", "w": "63", "y": "166", "x": "428", "id": "72157630500218256"}, {"_content": "Dead Drunk", "author": "29492435@N02", "h": "25", "authorname": "Cuddly Nutter", "w": "25", "y": "338", "x": "165", "id": "72157630526870770"}]}, "server": "7128", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7533977572/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
