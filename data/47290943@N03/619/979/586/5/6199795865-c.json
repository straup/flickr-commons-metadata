Love this view north towards Dublin. \n\nStraffan station was demolished sometime in the early 80's, I was lucky enough to visit it just before it was knocked. It was unusual in the fact the platforms were on a slight curve,  It's twin gable brick design was typical of the GS&amp;WR design, identical to Hazelhatch, Sallins, Kildare, all which still stand.  Straffan was the scene of one of Irelands earliest railway accident on October 5, 1853 in which 18 people died including four children. It occurred in heavy fog when a goods train ran in to the back of a stalled passenger train at a point 974 yards (891 m) south of Straffan Station. The goods train smashed the first class carriage, which was driven a quarter of a mile through station. The tragedy was the subject of a poem by Donegal-born poet William Allingham. It was the third worst accident in rail history to that date. Straffan station was last used for scheduled services in 1947 and the last special train stopped at Straffan in 1963. Straffan railway station opened on 1 August 1848 and finally closed on 10 November 1947.
