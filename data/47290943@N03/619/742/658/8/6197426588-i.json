At the time, it was expected that construction would be finished by the end of October or in early November.\n\nIt was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, 28 September 1932 that:\n&quot;The construction of the Station - one of the most powerful in Europe - was &quot;rushed&quot; for the Eucharistic Congress, the Post Office engineers then succeeding beyond expectations, and the Station gave the utmost satisfaction. The structure, however, was only of a temporary character, and had to be dismantled, so that a permanent work might be undertaken by the contractors.&quot;\n\nBut back to the photo itself! Fantastic background from <b>Bob Montgomery 2012</b>:\n&quot;<i>So, a memento of Jim Mollison's East West crossing of the Atlantic at the start of which he took off from The Velvet Strand, Portmarnock. The De Havilland Puss Moth was named 'The Heart's Content'. Mollison was married to Amy Johnson the famous aviatrix who accompanied him to Ireland for the start of his flight. Amy's famous airplane was named 'Jason' and while they were waiting for good weather to allow Mollison to take-off they attended a reception in the Ballsbridge house of the Fitzsimmons (Publishers - Talbot Press &amp; the Educational Company). At the reception Amy discovered the son of her hosts had the middle name 'Jason', as on her plane. She arranged to take Wilford Jason Fitzsimmons for a flight at the airfield at Kildonan, Finglas - an experience he treasured for the rest of his life.\n\nJim Mollison took off from Portmarnock in DH Puss Moth 'The Heart's Content' (G-ABXY) on August 18th 1932 and landed at Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick, 31 hours and 20 minutes later becoming the first person to make a solo crossing of the Atlantic from East to West.\n\nThis looks like a memento rather than a model as it has an engraved plaque on it. I believe I have seen the person holding it elsewhere but cannot recall where at present.</i>&quot;\n\nNot only has <b>Bob Montgomery 2012</b> completely brought this photo to life, but he has also identified the man as John J. Horgan!
