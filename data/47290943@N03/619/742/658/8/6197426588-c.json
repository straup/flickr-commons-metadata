The De Havilland Puss Moth was named 'The Heart's Content'. Mollison was married to Amy Johnson the famous aviiatrix who accompanied him to Ireland for the start of his flight. Amy's famous airplane was named 'Jason' and while they were waiting for good weather to allow Mollison to take-off they attended a reception in the Ballsbridge house of the Fitzsimmons (Publishers - Talbot Press &amp; the Educational Company). At the reception Amy discovered the son of her hosts had the middle name 'Jason', as on her plane. She arranged to take Wilford Jason Fitzsimmons for a flight at the airfield at Kildonan, Finglas - an experience he treasured for the rest of his life.\n\nJim Mollison took off from Portmarnock in DH Puss Moth 'The Heart's Content' (G-ABXY) on August 18th 1932 and landed at Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick, 31 hours and 20 minutes later becoming the first person to make a solo crossing of the Atlantic from East to West.\n\nThis looks like a memento rather than a model as it has an engraved plaque on it.

He may have been a photographer for The Irish Independent at one time although he may only have operated on a free-lance basis for them. In the 1930s and 1950s he built up a reputation as an aviation photographer. In the 1950s he lived at 'Innisrowan', Ballymun Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. I have two reference photographs of him - one taken in 1937 and one taken about 1950/51. In the first he is identifiable as the person in the photograph holding the model of Mollison's Puss Moth. In the second he is much heavier and it would be hard to be sure it is the same person.
