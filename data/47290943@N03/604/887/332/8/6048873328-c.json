As an Englishman who's lived extensively in Ireland, absorbed a lot of the Easter Rising legend and mythology at first hand (I had ancient neighbours in Clare who were DeValera men from their earliest youth), yet who also was an English consumer of the Thatcher doctrine of &quot;no oxygen of publicity for terrorists&quot; (aka total denial of any argument or debate in a public arena) in the 70s/80s, I find Collins especially fascinating. The widely acknowledged inventor of &quot;modern&quot; terror warfare, non-uniformed guerrilla tactics where the participants simply disappear, yet the same man who went knowingly to his eventual death signing a compromise treaty he knew pragmatically was the best he could hope for at the time, but would not satisfy many of those who'd stood beside him. \n\nIrish history and the troubled relationship with Britain, and the personalities of those who made it should be better known, thought about and understood. So many on every side of the argument take simplistic views, but it's so hugely complex. \n\nSorry for waffling!", "authorname": "SteveFE", "id": "47267889-6048873328-72157627339085369", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6048873328/#comment72157627339885351", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1313696122", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevefe] That's not waffle, Steve!
