It was all over the UK press and media last week.\n\nThe distillery wasn't founded in 1608. It is not the oldest in the world. In that respect it is a phoney. \n\nAs Jim Murray has written, in his usual forthright style, &quot;&quot;the Bushmills Old Distillery Co was not formed until 175 years later.&quot; \n\nThere are those who believe it wasn't even founded in 1784. Charles Craig could find no evidence of a distillery on the site prior to 1833.\n\nJim Murray points out (Classic Irish Whiskey, p55) that Middleton Distillery has exactly the same right to claim a 1608 foundation date.
