Manager was Thomas Weaver.\n - 1798: Two mine managers were rewarded for their &quot;spirited and judicious conduct&quot; in dealing with insurgents during rebellion.\n - 1811: Williams Brothers (Cornwall) acquired mine (see Williams Shaft Engine House marked) until 1884.\n - 1840 - 1880: pyrite also mined for sulfur (a very unpleasant process). \nDuring 19th century, technological innovations included steam to power water pumps (it would have been a horse going in a circle before this), a tramway to transport ores to Arklow (for Swansea).\n - 1880: Large scale mining ceased.\n - 1956: Mianra\u00ed Teoranta explored potential for sulfur and copper mining.
