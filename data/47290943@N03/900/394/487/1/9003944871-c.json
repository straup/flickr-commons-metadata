Longman &amp; Broderip was a music publishing house, but the firm also built a number of pianos and organs. The first listing for Longman &amp; Broderip was at 26 Cheapside, London, later at 15 Haymarket, London. The famous composer and piano virtuoso, Muzio Clementi (whose music was published by Longman &amp; Broderip) invested heavily in the firm, ultimately creating an association with F. W. and W. P. Collard under the name of 'Clementi &amp; Company'. Because of Clementi's fame and fortune, the firm was very successful and grew at a rapid pace. F. W. Collard was also a mechanical genius, and he was awarded several patents for piano design and construction, and instruments by the firm were a sensation across Europe. Muzio Clementi retired by 1815 and the name of the firm was changed to 'Collard &amp; Collard'. During the middle 19th Century, the firm was managed by Charles Lukey Collard, and he continued to move the firm to the forefront of piano manufacturing in Europe, making Collard &amp; Collard one of the most popular and successful European piano manufacturers of all time. In 1929, the firm was sold to the Chappell Piano Company of London, and the Collard &amp; Collard name was produced until about 1960.", "authorname": "BearaBoy", "id": "47267889-9003944871-72157634105093288", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9003944871/#comment72157634105288914", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1371129280", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/92418093@N08] Excellent, thank you!
