We now know these gentlemen were The Fort Warders or Castlemen aka Hillsborough Old Guard.Their motto was Semper Floreat.\n\nThis, from the <a href=\"http://www.hillsborougholdguard.co.uk/fort-warders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Fort Warders website</b></a>, gives a great idea of how vibrant these uniforms must have been:\n<blockquote>The Warders or &quot;Castlemen&quot; were paid to protect the Fort which commanded a very strategic position on the road from Carrickfergus to Dublin.The Fort was further improved by the 1st Marquis of Downshire in the mid 18th century. By the end of the nineteenth century, with the Warders role being mainly ceremonial, the Government no longer wished to pay for maintaining  them and an arrangement was made to retain only the Bugler when the remaining Warders passed on. Their uniform, it is said hadn't changed since 1688.They were clothed in blue tunics, turned up with red and trimmed with white lace, white breeches and leggings with a large cocked hat and a red feathered plume. Their arms consisted of a musket, bayonet &amp; sword. The last of the original remaining Warders died in 1954 with only the Bugler now remaining for ceremonial duties. </blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9299539404-72157634661120579", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9299539404/#comment72157634661664407", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1373987668", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/shanekillen] Thanks for confirmation!", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-9299539404-72157634661664407", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9299539404/#comment72157634668626572", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1373989873", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/8468254@N02] Good Job.", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "47267889-9299539404-72157634668626572", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/9299539404/#comment72157634668759032", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8468254@N02", "iconserver": "232", "datecreate": "1373990555", "_content": "If you need further local colour, I can advise you that the slopes of the embankments inside the fort are probably the finest slopes on the island for rolling down.
