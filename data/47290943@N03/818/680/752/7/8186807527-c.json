I have established that:\n<blockquote>The manufacturers came into existence around 1790 under the name of Handley and Moore, two men who had been apprenticed together under John Thwaites. John Moore took complete charge of the firm around 1821, when George Handley died.  His sons joined him in the trade, so that by 1829 the firm was established as John Moore &amp; Sons. Their new firm was to produce an incredible array of movements which could be found everywhere in society: libraries, ships, halls, railway waiting rooms and kitchens, as well as church towers (turret clocks).   When Henry J Moore died in 1899, the firm ceased production.</blockquote>\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland] Carol, I think you can safely date the photo between 1870 and 1876.", "authorname": "Gerry Ward", "id": "47267889-8186807527-72157632025525928", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8186807527/#comment72157632026726103", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1353132526", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/gerryward] That is good work,  well done you.
