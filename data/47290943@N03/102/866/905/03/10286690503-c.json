Yesterday the service was replaced by ten new double-deck 'buses.\nThe elimination of tram cars on all routes north of Nelson Pillar is now complete. The last tram left the Phoenix Park gates for Donnybrook at 11.30 on Saturday night. Some of the passengers who travelled in it for sentimental reasons, had been passengers on the first tram which opened the service just over 40 years ago.\nAccordions, saxaphones [sic] and violins played the tram &quot;home&quot; on its final run. The reception at Donnybrook was attended by over four hundred people who joined in singing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-10286690503-72157636583163404", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/10286690503/#comment72157636583670553", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nlireland", "author": "47290943@N03", "iconserver": "5468", "datecreate": "1381844682", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/8468254@N02] Put it down to sheer recklessness!
