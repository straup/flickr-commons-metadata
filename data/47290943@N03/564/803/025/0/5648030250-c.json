There were a lot of these along the quays in Limerick and many of them had plates on the top stating the name of the foundry where they were made.  When you look at this shot you will note the light coloured buildings inside the walls of King Johns Castle?  This was the Castle Barracks and was used right up to the treaty in 1922 and perhaps thereafter.  In the 1950's these were still there but now converted into tenements.  The conical roof on the tower was not there in my memory.  Those buildings look nice and shiny new so a date of their erection might help in dating the shot???", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-5648030250-72157631961769398", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/5648030250/#comment72157631962324979", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77199267@N03", "iconserver": "7180", "datecreate": "1352405090", "_content": "Looking at the horizon closely it looks like the sky has been scraped off the negative - is that possible?
