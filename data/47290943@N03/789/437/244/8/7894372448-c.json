It is actually a very ancient Irish word and appears in the 1817 supplement to O'Reilly's <i>Irish Dictionary</i> as &quot;In Irish folk-lore, A pigmy sprite \u2018who always carries a purse containing a shilling\u2019 &quot;.\n\nThese are examples of 17th century usage from the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>:\n1620   T. Dekker <i>Dreame</i> sig. D3,   Mounted on a Spirits back, which ran With Mandrake-shrikes, and like a Lubrican.\n1627   M. Drayton <i>Nimphidia in Battaile Agincovrt</i> 127   By the Mandrakes dreadfull groanes; By the Lubricans sad moanes.\n1630   T. Dekker Second Pt. <i>Honest Whore</i> sig. E3,   As for your Irish Lubrican, that spirit Whom by prepostrous charmes thy lust hath raised In a wrong Circle.\n\nAnd again, from the very reliable <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> an etymology of the word Leprechaun:\n<blockquote>&quot;Written <i>luprac\u00e1n, lugharc\u00e1n, lugrac\u00e1n</i>, in O'Reilly <i>Irish. Dict.</i> Suppl.; in the body of the Dict. it is spelt  <i>leithbr\u00e1gan</i>, doubtless by etymologizing perversion, the sprite being \u2018supposed to be always employed in making or mending a single shoe\u2019 (<i>leith</i> half, <i>br\u00f3g</i> brogue); O'Reilly also gives <i>luacharman</i> as a synonym. In some mod. Irish books the spelling <i>lioprach\u00e1n</i> occurs. All these forms may be corrupted from one original; compare Middle Irish <i>luchrup\u00e1n</i> (Windisch Gloss.), altered form of Old Irish <i>luchorp\u00e1n</i> (Stokes in <i>Revue Celtique</i> I. 256), <i>lu</i> small + <i>corp</i> body.&quot;</blockquote>", "authorname": "National Library of Ireland on The Commons", "id": "47267889-7894372448-72157631349662518", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7894372448/#comment72157631349886362", "realname": "", "path_alias": "shanekillen", "author": "29492435@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1346504674", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/38401430@N06] I've heard of that too only in the version I heard it was from Manx.", "authorname": "Cuddly Nutter", "id": "47267889-7894372448-72157631349886362", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7894372448/#comment72157631350251356", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "38401430@N06", "iconserver": "2885", "datecreate": "1346506519", "_content": "CUddly - I am JOKING(!)", "authorname": "billh35", "id": "47267889-7894372448-72157631350251356", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/7894372448/#comment72157631350271012", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "38401430@N06", "iconserver": "2885", "datecreate": "1346506611", "_content": "NLI - I am Irish and I don't find it offensive at all.
