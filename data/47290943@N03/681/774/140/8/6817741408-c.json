The first explosion on 8 March did some damage in the street, but not a lot. The army explosion did a lot more.

The army did a great job.\n\nThe whole thing was was very exciting. Like a night out. The remains of the pillar were floodlit and  I think it was Kevin O'Kelly who did the countdown over the PA (no doubt practicing for the moon landing). There was a huge cheer when it went up - a great party atmosphere in the street.
