In 1843 he branched-out into bell founding, casting a bell for the Roman Catholic church in Tuam in County Galway. In the years that followed Murphy cast many single bells and at least eight rings of bells.\n\nMany of Murphy\u2019s bells were thinner in profile than bells cast by other founders and intended for ringing, but that did not prevent Murphy bells being awarded prizes at the Dublin and London Exhibitions and First Prize in 1900 at the Paris Exhibition.\n\nJohn Murphy, who had founded the business, died in 1875. His son, John J. Murphy, then ran the foundry until it eventually closed. John J. died in 1948. In 1885 Matthew O\u2019Byrne, who ran a foundry in James Street in Dublin, persuaded James Gaskin to join him. Gaskin had been the bell-maker at Murphy\u2019s. Thereafter the Murphy Bell Foundry declined. According to Fred Dukes the last dated bell traceable to Murphy\u2019s was cast in 1900.", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "47267889-6812307984-72157629160047510", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6812307984/#comment72157629160683920", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1331036576", "_content": "Suspended Carol, suspended!
