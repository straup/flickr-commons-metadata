The roadway, Barrack Hill, is just to the right of the point where the photo was taken.  The wall n the right looks like that for the Model School but the position is wrong and I suspect that the Municipal Technical Institute is in that spot now.  The roadway you see on the left leads over to Mount St. Alphonsus, a large Redemptorist Fathers establishment.  Frank McCourt the author of Angelas Ashes would have spent much of his time near here living at different times either side of where the photo was taken.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "47267889-5720040074-72157627555511388", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5720040074"}}
