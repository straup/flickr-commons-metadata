They are all moored about 10 to 15 feet from the quay wall, obviously because the bottom sloped up rapidly, and there is a plank across that considerable gap.  Talk about walking the plank.

You can see another ship in the background either getting ready to dock or to leave and judging by the tiny bow wave the tide is flowing so it may be leaving.  It is possible that there was a small jetty or dock over on the Scotch Hall side where actual unloading was done, unless of course these were passenger ships taking emigrants to far away places?
