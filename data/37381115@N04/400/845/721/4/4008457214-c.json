Maybe this is correct. I have no insight in the source of this estimation, and im not qualified to compare this with other lithos showing Liszt at an age of ca. 19 years.\n\nThe lithography is created at a later date. It is signed by Josef Kriehuber, lithographer from Vienna, with the year 1846.\nThe publiction in form of this postcard must also be from a later date for two reasons. \nFirst, In 1846 the term Hofphotograph (court photographer) wasnt established. \nSecond, the publisher Louis Held was born 1851. He opened his first studio in 1876 in Liegnitz (today: Legnica) and moved to Weimar in 1882. I dont know when he acclaimed the title Hofphotograph, but he lost the title in 1905. This means the publication is from between 1882+X and 1905.", "authorname": "Martin H2", "id": "37348976-4008457214-72157629420824980", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4008457214"}}
