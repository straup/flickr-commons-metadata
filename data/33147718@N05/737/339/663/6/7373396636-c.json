Maybe an earlier regatta or the sesquicentenary in 1938? \n\nLATER: again sorry - round scuttles on the compass platform. It's HMAS CANBERRA [I] not AUSTRALIA [square windows there pre-WWI]I. She's wearing an admiral flag on the foremast too, which tallies - CANBERRA was flagship for most of the 1930s.", "authorname": "Kookaburra2011", "id": "33142378-7373396636-72157632649848622", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7373396636/#comment72157632692795458", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1360031092", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05] Thanks for those details Kookaburra2011, we had the same issues with the following pics.
