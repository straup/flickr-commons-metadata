The Hall collection combines photographs from both William J Hall and his father William Frederick Hall - the latter of which is likely to have taken this image. The images provide an important pictorial record of recreational boating in Sydney Harbour, from the 1890s to the 1930s \u2013 from large racing and cruising yachts, to the many and varied skiffs jostling on the harbour, to the new phenomenon of motor boating in the early twentieth century. The collection also includes studio portraits and images of the many spectators and crowds who followed the sailing races.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. If you can identify a person, vessel or landmark, write the details in the Comments box below. \n\nThank you for helping caption this important historical image.\n\nObject number 00010677"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "859", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1920-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1365722591", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1365641692"}, "originalsecret": "b8a9f44d21", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "Two ferries packed with spectators", "author": "32162360@N00", "h": "41", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "w": "45", "y": "213", "x": "328", "id": "72157633216012823"}, {"_content": "St Patricks Seminary, Manly", "author": "32162360@N00", "h": "13", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "w": "16", "y": "232", "x": "297", "id": "72157633220738950"}, {"_content": "Georges Heights barracks", "author": "32162360@N00", "h": "14", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "w": "105", "y": "218", "x": "16", "id": "72157633216023393"}]}, "server": "8520", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8638194297/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387835010}
