Byrne and built in 1878 by R. Steel &amp; Co of Greenock for Sir Thomas Hesketh.  He set off round the world in what seems to have been a copy of the vovage of the Sunbeam, a sister ship of Lancashire Witch again designed by St Clare Byrne.  The story of this voyage of the Sunbeam was published by Anna Brassey in her popular book &quot;A Voyage in the Sunbeam, our Home on the Ocean for Eleven Months&quot; published in 1878.  A scanned copy can be read on the Internet Archive.  She saw the Lancashire Witch on its shakedown cruise in Gibraltar and remarked how similar the two yachts were.  The Lancashire Witch had many adventures before she became the Waterwitch and we should write this up sometime.  A journalist - Francis Francis the younger - did write a book about the first voyage of the  Lancashire Witch called &quot;War, Waves and Wanderings. A cruise in the &quot;Lancashire Witch.&quot;&quot;  but this was part fiction and part fact so not a good historic document.  Again available on the Internet Archive.  On his trip in the Lancashire Witch Hesketh stopped off to fight in the Zulu wars and when he got to San Francisco met and married possibly the richest heiress in America.  \nLater owner was Frank Linsly James who with his brothers explored uncharted areas of Africa.  He was killed by an elephant and his body returned to England on board the Lancashire Witch (1890).", "authorname": "tedrobbens", "id": "33142378-8052244035-72157633457204632", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8052244035/#comment72157633457396594", "realname": "Ted", "path_alias": "sidpickle", "author": "89563874@N07", "iconserver": "7402", "datecreate": "1368122069", "_content": "In addition to her being a ship that could face the worst seas, she could scrub up well.

The German emperor arrived, and a procession of government vessels and yachts went to meet him. The Lancashire Witch was given a good position on the port bow of the imperial yacht, and we could see the emperor and his staff as we went to Cowes.

Not seeing anything of the boats, which were also to leave Sydney at 2.30, we steamed as slowly as possible in order not to meet them too soon. A very pretty sight it was when we beheld the Volunteers approaching in two regular lines of boats, accompanied by crowds of people in small sailing and rowing boats, as well as launches and steamers, all apparently perilously overloaded with passengers.\n\nWhen the Volunteers reached the yacht they all tossed their oars and stood up and saluted. Then the commanding officers came alongside, and we received them on board. It really was a lovely sight, and my only wish was to be, like the famous bird, in two places at once\u2014namely, where I was, to help to entertain the Volunteers and thank them for their warm and kindly welcome, and on shore to look at the dear old 'Sunbeam' surrounded by the mosquito fleet, through which she had considerable difficulty in making her way without doing any damage. It took some time for all the officers and men to come on board to have some refreshment and look over the yacht, and it was therefore rather late before the commanding officer rowed us ashore in his gig. We landed at the man-of-war steps, close to Government House, where a large crowd had assembled to give us another welcome. They formed a little lane for us to pass through, cheering lustily, and smiling and nodding as if they were glad to see us. There was nothing formal or obtrusive about their welcome. It was, in truth, a real, warm, honest greeting from friends across the sea, and it touched both Tom and myself deeply. All such demonstrations invariably give me a choking sensation in my throat, and I was not altogether sorry when we had made our way through the crowd of kindly welcomers and reached the steep pathway leading to Government House. Halfway up we could stop and survey the scene, and I was able to partially gratify my wish to see the yacht from the shore with the boats around it.</i>\n</blockquote>\nfrom - <a href=\"http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/120512/29778/www.digilibraries.com@29778@29778-h@29778-h-2.htm#CHAPTER_XIV\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/120512/29778/www.digili...</a>\nAnnie Brassey 'The Last Voyage, to India and Australia, in the 'Sunbeam' ' 1887, Chapter XIV", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8052244035-72157633532903838", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8052244035/#comment72157633534305418", "realname": "Ted", "path_alias": "sidpickle", "author": "89563874@N07", "iconserver": "7402", "datecreate": "1368976946", "_content": "By Gad sir, yes, the white ship at the top of this page matches a photo of Sunbeam I have in the book &quot;The Luxury Yachts from Steam to Diesel&quot; - R Crabtree 1973 page 36.

The Sunbeam was sadly broken up at the start of the twentieth century, but the figurehead is kept at the National Maritime Museum, London and is beautiful.  There is a picture on my blog recording some of the research I've done in the UK and will follow the project.  <a href=\"http://www.bexhilltobexhill.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bexhilltobexhill.com</a>", "authorname": "louisekenward", "id": "33142378-8052244035-72157635753153546", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8052244035/#comment72157635778334306", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1379889858", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/102821679@N08] Thanks for your comment Louise, so glad you came across the images. I have <a href=\"http://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/around-the-world-in-the-1800s-part-1-the-voyage-of-the-sunbeam/\" rel=\"nofollow\">written a blog on the Brassey's</a> visit to Australia (it could have been much longer) and the National Maritime Museum (UK) kindly allowed me to use an image of the figurehead. I agree with you it is so beautiful it appears to glow! Hopefully I can visit the NMM and the Hastings Museum one of these days, however our lovely Flickr user Ted Robbens has sent me many images in the meantime. Will follow your journey with interest. Let me know if you are coming to the Maritime Museum in Sydney!
