In this case no, it\u2019s not odd to have so many sails up,  because the 18s were renowned for putting as much sail on as possible, so all sorts of extra sails were put up in the right conditions. In this case they have put up a small spinnaker, but they could also have put up an additional sail attached to the mainsail ( the one with the insignia). In fact it is odd they have not put this other sail up, called a ringtail, and neither have any of the other boats, it suggests a special race, perhaps a more social one, where there was an agreed limit to what sails they would use.&quot;", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-7975544873-72157631515431404", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7975544873"}, "flarchive:created": 1387836285}
