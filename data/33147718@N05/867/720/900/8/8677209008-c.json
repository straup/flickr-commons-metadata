I have a picture of Dart in a book about the hydro graphic survey work carried out at this time and they are not the same vessel.  However, mine has to be wrong, as it is a three masted ugly ship and the above photo shows an elegant vessel.  According to Lloyds register Dart was designed by St Clare John Byrne and he would not have built an ugly boat.  Dart was built in 1877 in Barrow.
