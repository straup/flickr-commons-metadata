In May 1910, it was sold to Aug Bolten of Hamburg, Germany and renamed GUSTAV. It was sold again in 1913 to Vinnen Gebr of Hamburg. On 19 December 1926, GUSTAV arrived in Sydney after a 14-day voyage from Auckland. The barque anchored in Rose Bay to load a full cargo of wheat. On 1 February 1927 the barque sailed for the United Kingdom. Later that year, GUSTAV was sold to HWFM Engel of Altona, Victoria and renamed MELBOURNE; however, within a year it was sold again to Captain Gustaf Erikson of Mariehamn in Aland, Finland. In June 1930, the barque was run down and sunk by the tanker MT SEMINOLE off South Fastnet, Ireland. The captain and 10 members of the crew were drowned while 15 others survived.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J. Hood Studio collection.
