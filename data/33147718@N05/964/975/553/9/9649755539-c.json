I was told it was some time in or about the 1850's ..... is that correct? I see the gentlemen in this image is taking photos ... I would like to shake his hand and say thank-u very-very much Sir!!!   Just keep in mind, some day all the pictures you and I take others will be looking at them 100 years or much longer than that thanking us both for all the pictures that we have taken here &amp; now in this time period. I go out &amp; about taking pictures of new cars, and people are wondering why, [???] ... well you ever wonder what these new cars will look like in about 150 years from now? You ever think about how people will be dressed and what they will look like hen? Or ho strange we will be looking to them by the way we are now dressing and looking? Look how this man is dressed in this image .... he never knew what blue jeans were back in his day ..... poor-fellow!  Sorry, but I could go on-and-on about this.
