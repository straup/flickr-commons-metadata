Although steel had already been introduced into the P&amp;O fleet, it was in short supply, so CARTHAGE and her elder sister ROME, P&amp;O\u2019s biggest ships to date, were built of iron. Designed to compete with the latest Orient Line tonnage on the Australian route they pioneered the impressive four mast/two funnel/two tier deckhouses profile that became P&amp;O\u2019s traditional style. \n26/10/1881: Maiden voyage to Australia. \n1882: Employed as a hospital ship during the Egyptian Campaign. \n1886: Searchlight fitted, thus allowing CARTHAGE to become the first ship to transit the Suez Canal at night. \n1891: Plans were made to lengthen and refit her, as was done with her sister ROME. However, they were abandoned on grounds of cost. \n1892: Yards removed. Transferred to Bombay service. \n1897: Carried distinguished foreign guests to the Diamond Jubilee Review. \n1900~01: Employed as a transport and hospital ship during the Boxer Rebellion in China. \n1902: Carried guests to King Edward VII\u2019s Coronation Review, hitting the quay at Southampton when landing them. \n30/12/1902: Laid up at Bombay. \n06/05/1903: Sold for \u00a310,749 to Essafji Tajbhoy Borah for demolition at Mazagon Powder Works, Bombay. \n</blockquote>\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=15274\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=15274</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8724028831-72157633469307544", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8724028831/#comment72157633498915756", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1368590738", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Nice one, thanks BC!
