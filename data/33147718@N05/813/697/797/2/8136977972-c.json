The following year the same yard and same designer built Ladye Mabel for Lord Ashbuton.  A year later the yacht was purchased by George Alexander Baird as a present for Lillie Langtry  (following a slight disturbance in a Paris hotel room) and renamed White Ladye.  On the web it is possible to find references that the White Ladye became HMS Waterwitch and this has been disproven as a myth following research and a documented audit trail of Lloyd's registers for both yachts.  Although not linked to the yacht but of Australian interest:  Langtry was told of an Australian race horse called Merman that was a good prospect and had him shipped over to  the UK.
