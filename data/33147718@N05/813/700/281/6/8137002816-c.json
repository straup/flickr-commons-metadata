A. Dibbs. As the vessel left the ways, she was christened Ena, by Miss Dorothy Dibbs. The launch went off without a hitch, the vessel taking the water almost without a move in her cradle. The Ena is100ft overall, by 16ft beam, 8ft 61n deep, and she will draw 7ft 3in. On deck she will be fitted with elegant circular top skylights, with embossed glass. There is a deckhouse amidships, combining funnel casing, steering platform, stokehole-entrance, galley, and engine-roo: i. so arranged that while giving ample room for their respective purposes, ample promenade space remains. Forward is a steam capstan, of the very latest design, and the steering gear is similar to that fitted in her Majesty's yacht. The latter has been specially imported. Below are two magnificent saloon cabins; the forward, or ladies', saloon, is 18ft long by the full width of the ship, in which are six berths, with everything arranged with a view to convenience; the after, or gentlemen's, cabin, is 16ft long, and has berth accommodation for no fewer than eight persons. Lavatory arrangements are provided at both ends of - the yacht. The Ena is schooner-rigged, with a permanent awning over the main body, and a white canvas portable awning covers the quarter-deck and bow. She carries two boats in davits arranged so that they may be brought in on deck during bad weather at sea.The gangway is a special feature, giving the ease of access of a grand stairway. Steam at 1201bpressure will be supplied by a large return tube marine type boiler, to compound surface condensing engines, having cyclinders 12in and 24in diameter, and 16in stroke, both with piston valves. The condenser is independent, and placed In the port wing, the air, feed, and bilge pumps being worked off the main ccosshead ; circulating pump being an independent Worthington, which together with the universal donkey and injector, make up a very complete outfit. Electricity for lighting purposes will be generated by a Crompton direct coupled 8-horse power plant, giving power to brilliantly illuminate the vessel fore and aft. The new yacht is from designs by Mr. Walter Reeks, and was built by Mr. W. M. Ford, Berry's Bay. The machinery is by Messrs. Chapman and Company. - The inside fittings, which are all of specially selected polished oak, from the old warship Nelson (where they have been seasoning nearly-100 years), are by Messrs, W. Walker, Son, and Bartholomew. Every possible effort will be made to expedite completion, and the Ena'is expected to be in commission early in the new year. Steam Yacht Ena. (1900, December 22).
