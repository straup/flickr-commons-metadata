The passenger liner was active on the Pacific trade route from 1912 until it was requisitioned for service during World War I and II. RMS NIAGRA was an Ocean liner launched on 17 August 1912 and used for transporting passengers and mail on the trans- Pacific trade route. It was built by John Brown &amp; Company, Clydebank and owned by the Union Steam Ship Company. During World War II NIAGRA was in service with the Canadian-Australasian Line from Auckland, New Zealand, to Suva and Vancouver. It sank on 19 June 1940 after it struck a mine laid by Germans off the north coast of New Zealand. \n\n\nFrederick Wilkinson (1901 - 1975) migrated to Australia from England in 1911. While working various jobs in and around central Sydney, Wilkinson acquired a camera and began taking photographs of vessels and harbour scenes.
