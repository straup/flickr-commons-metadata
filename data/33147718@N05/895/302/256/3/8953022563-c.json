May 1864...and was nearing completion in February 1865...there was a fairly substantial fire at the Blackwall Stores in 1870 <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70457651\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70457651</a> ...but the outer walls appear to have escaped unscathed...and the stores survived well into the 20th century.\n\nThe Talbot stores were built on either side of what later became the Moore Steps thoroughfare. Various digitised newspaper hits (search under 'City Improvements' and 'Talbot') indicate the Talbot Stores were under construction in February 1863...but it's not clear whether both Talbot stores were all built at this time...Talbot came into conflict with municipal authorities in 1867 when the council decided to build the Moore Steps...per the digitised newspapers, a wall on one of the stores (then under construction) toppled when council workers filled in a partly excavated cellar...which didn't exactly impress Talbot. Hitherto Talbot had evidently had the run of the thoroughfare between his stores, and he wasn't happy with the council decision to build the stairs and improve public access to East Circular Quay...enough there for a TV mini series...\n\nDoes anyone have any info on the ?house/building between the Hill Clark &amp; Co warehouse and the Blackwall stores?
