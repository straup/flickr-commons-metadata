The squadron consisted of the cruisers HIJMS IZUMO, commanded by Captain M Hirota and HIJMS YAKUMO, commanded by Captain M Idemitsu. Among the 1,600 men on board the cruisers was Sub-Lieutenant Prince Takamatsu, the third son of HIM Emperor Taisho, the 123rd Emperor of Japan.\n\nThe regular formalities were observed upon their arrival, including the laying of a wreath on the Sydney Cenotaph in Martin Place in honour of those who lost their lives during World War I. That night, a welcome banquet was also hosted by the Japanese Consul-General, Prince Iemasa Tokugawa, the 17th head of the Tokugawa clan (a powerful family that ruled Japan as Shoguns from 1603 to 1867). Also in attendance were Sir William Cullen, Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, Prime Minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce and Lord John Lawrence Baird Stonehaven, the Governor-General of Australia.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J. Hood Studio collection. Sam Hood (1872-1953) was a Sydney photographer with a passion for ships. His 60-year career spanned the romantic age of sail and two world wars. The photos in the collection were taken mainly in Sydney and Newcastle during the first half of the 20th century. \n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
