This black and white photograph depicts a group of soldiers of the No 1 Squadron, Flying Corps, AIF, standing at attention on a wharf. They are wearing their military uniform including slouch hat and have their kits bags at their feet.\n\n The soldier in the centre, F.C. Davis, has an Australian flag sticking out of his shirt pocket. The reverse has a handwritten inscription in lead pencil reading: &quot;ORSOVA  16/3/16&quot;. Two men in this image are identifiable from the text on their kit bags. Centre is Frederick Charles Davis 217 and to the right of him is Lieutenant Eric Glendower Roberts. Davis returned to Australia in March 1919 and Roberts was retired with shell shock around March 1917.\n\nThe individual second from left, from row has what appears to be the number '208' on his kit bag. This gentleman is likely to be Alan Otto Andersen of 1 Flying Squadron AFC.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
