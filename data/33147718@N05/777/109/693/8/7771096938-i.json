Disaster struck the liner during a voyage from Sydney to San Francisco, however the SS VENTURA and SS PENYBRYN were on hand to assist with a mid-ocean rescue. Returning to Australia and New Zealand, some of the survivors and rescuers found a ready market for their images of the incident amongst New Zealand and Australian newspapers and movie houses.

The collision occurred off Bradley's Head and resulted in the ferry sinking immediately with the loss of 37 lives, many of them school children.
