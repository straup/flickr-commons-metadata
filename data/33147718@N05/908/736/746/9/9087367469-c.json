They just aren't.  The sole purpose of the bowsprit is to extend the length of the sail carrying platform.\n\nThere is an interesting story about 12 foot skiffs.  Until after WW2 they were hugely overcanvassed and carried huge crews as ballast.  A bloke named Iain Oughtred designed a boat called a Gwen 12 - also 12 feet long, but lightweight with a planing hull and ballasted by crew on a trapeze (if you do not know what a trapeze is look at some of my photos of 18 footers.  The guys on the wires are trapezing).  The skiffies laughed at them, so the Gwen 12 sailors challenged the skiffies to a race, and cleaned them up.  It was the beginning of the evolution of skiffs to their modern form.  This should be a photo of a Gwen 12 - you can see the difference to a vintage skiff <a href=\"http://lostinablog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/20110225-151323.jpg?w=490\" rel=\"nofollow\">lostinablog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/20110225-151323.j...</a>", "authorname": "iansand", "id": "33142378-9087367469-72157634245539784", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9087367469/#comment72157634317212776", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1372135728", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/iansand] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/67349057@N06] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Yes thank you! Bit of an oversight with this image, definitely not an 18-footer. Our vessels curator has gone on holiday (how could he?!) but the book 'Australian Wooden Boats Vol1' (1994) has an entry for '8-footer ZEPHYR'. \n\n&quot;In a set of notes made by Harry Pritchard... he says: '1891. While chatting with his father Charles Pritchard who remarked whether the limit of a beam of a sailing boat had been reached, H.C. Pritchard made a scale model which so pleased them both that they decided to build it. She was ZEPHYR, 8' long and 8' beam, which was eventually sailed by Irene Pritchard on tiller, H. Pritchard on mainsheet and Fred Pritchard on jib'.&quot;\n\nOther useful details: ZEPHYR carried an 18' mast, 16' boom, a 10'6&quot; gaff and a 10' bowsprit.\n\n Meanwhile, here's another image of ZEPHYR we prepared earlier...\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9130656983/\" title=\"Yacht ZEPHYR on Sydney Harbour by Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7434/9130656983_69256528ee_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"78\" alt=\"Yacht ZEPHYR on Sydney Harbour\" /></a>", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-9087367469-72157634317212776", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9087367469"}, "flarchive:created": 1387834599}
