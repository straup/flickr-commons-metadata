Drawn towards cliffs by a strong current, the ship was pulled into cave where the movement of the sea caused the vessel's masts to strike against the roof, eventually pushing them through the base of the ship and causing it to sink. 68 people, including the captain, perished.\n\nHowever ten of the crew and five passengers including David Ashworth managed to get ashore and eventually find sanctuary in several huts which had been built on the islands by the whalers Samuel and Charles Enderby, who had established a colony at Port Ross, Auckland Islands. \n\nFor the next seven months the 15 survivors, Peter McNevin, Andrew Morrison, David McClelland, Chief Officer Bartholomew Brown, William Newton Scott, Cornelius Drew, James Teer, David Ashworth, Joseph Jewell, Mary Ann Jewell, William Sanguily, Arron Hayman (Harpman), William Ferguson, F P Caughley and Nicholas Allen, managed to live in freezing conditions and endure the severest hardships on the Auckland Islands. \n\nEventually giving up all hope of being rescued by a passing ship four of the men departed the Islands in a makeshift boat in January 1867 attempting to sail to the small town of Bluff on New Zealand's South Island. The boat and its crew were never seen again. \n\nThe remaining 10 (one died from exposure) survivors lived on the Islands for nearly 18 months before being rescued by the brig AMHERST in November 1868. Ashworth joined an attempt to return to the wrecksite and retrieve the gold and was drowned during salvage work in 1870.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
