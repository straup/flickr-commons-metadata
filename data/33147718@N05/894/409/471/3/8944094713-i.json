It is likely, due to the poor condition of the hull, that this photograph was taken after 1906 and before it was broken up in 1923.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J. Hood Studio collection. Sam Hood (1872-1953) was a Sydney photographer with a passion for ships. His 60-year career spanned the romantic age of sail and two world wars. The photos in the collection were taken mainly in Sydney and Newcastle during the first half of the 20th century. \n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: Samuel J.
