Amongst the pages of purple prose there is this gem - \n\n<blockquote>\n&quot; As to the marching, there is little doubt that British drill instructors would find it wanting in finish.  But democracy does not take kindly to drill instructors.  The British bluejacket marches with a pronounced roll,  but though never as steady as the marines,  he attains to a very fair degree of precision.  The British marines, as those who have seen them will remember,  march with machine-like steadiness.   But in the United States navy not so much attention is given to the niceties of parade marching.  The men covered the ground at a smart pace, and possibly that was all that was required of them.  But the crowd cheered them warmly -- and plainly liked their looks. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/1220140\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/1220140</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-7994895645-72157631573379291", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7994895645/#comment72157631578790468", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1348115039", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Good observation there!
