The ship in the background is the [unique] seaplane carrier HMAS Albatross, a vessel built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, laid down in April 1926, launched by Lady Stonehaven, wife of the Governor General and commissioned on January 23, 1929.\n\nKnown as 'Australia's first aircraft carrier' she was also armed with  four 4.7 inch guns, which are what would been being used for the  target practice here. \n \nFurther details of this ship are widely available, and ANMM will have them in your own records. With her RAN service affected by the Great Depression, she was transferred to the Royal Navy as part-payment for the cruiser HMAS Hobart [ex-HMS Apollo] in 1938, and had a significant career with the Royal Navy during WWII.\n\nBecame the migrant ship Hellenic Prince after WWII, and finally scrapped at Hong Kong in 1954.", "authorname": "Kookaburra2011", "id": "33142378-3403520568-72157624044093676", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/3403520568/#comment72157625307137310", "realname": "Roger", "path_alias": null, "author": "49015875@N00", "iconserver": "162", "datecreate": "1288825252", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Torrens_%28D67%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Torrens_%28D67%29</a> ??", "authorname": "victuallers2", "id": "33142378-3403520568-72157625307137310", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/3403520568/#comment72157627918625004", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1318893681", "_content": "Thanks for your comment Kookaburra2011.
