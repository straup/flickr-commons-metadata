P&amp;O had used the white colour scheme only twice before - briefly with CALEDONIA in the mid 1890s and with SALSETTE on the tropical Aden-Bombay route around 1910. An <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/32353870?searchTerm=Strath new white colour&amp;searchLimits=\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> on the launch of STRATHAIRD in 1931 mentions the new colour scheme.

The article in the response above mentions that the new white colour scheme of the 1930s produced lower temperatures onboard... phew... Interesting side note, apparently MONGOLIA's sister ship MOLDAVIA was fitted with a dummy second funnel in 1928 to 'provide a more impressive profile' - however it only exaggerated the vessel's top-heaviness so was thankfully not applied to MONGOLIA.
