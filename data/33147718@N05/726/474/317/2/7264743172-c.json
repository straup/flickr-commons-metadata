I don't know whether the particular stretch of fence which we see on the left in this pic remains today...I suspect that what we see today is a remnant of longer fence which stretched from North Quay to Milton...regardless, a good portion of this fence is still there...it sits on top of a retaining wall...and runs beside Coronation Drive from near the Grey Street bridge upstream to the Merivale Bridge...(check it out on Google street view...the brick pillars no longer have their ornamental caps, but the iron railings are the same).\n\nI'm not quite sure...trees obscure the view...but in the middle distance, I gather we see the Milton terraces (beside the river) and Milton House (on the higher ground).", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7264743172-72157634642788449", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7264743172/#comment72157634654664661", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1373940855", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Yikes!
