The yacht was built for politician Lord Thomas Brassey (1836-1918). Between July 1876 and May 1877 Lord Brassey, his wife Anna and their family sailed around the world on SUNBEAM, the first circumnavigation by a private steam yacht. This voyage was recorded in Lady Brassey's bestselling book 'A Voyage in the SUNBEAM'.\n\nThe family completed many more voyages and Lady Brassey wrote three more books on their adventures. The Brassey's last journey included a four month circumnavigation of Australia, in mid-1887. Sadly, Lady Brassey died four days out of Port Darwin and her last book, titled 'The Last Voyage, to India and Australia in the SUNBEAM', was published posthumously in 1889.\n\nLord Brassey returned to Australia in SUNBEAM in 1895 to take up his post as Governor of Victoria. He returned to England in 1900. In 1916 he have SUNBEAM to the Indian Government for use as a convalescent ship.\n\nRead our &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href=\"http://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/around-the-world-in-the-1800s-part-1-the-voyage-of-the-sunbeam/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; on SUNBEAM's 1887 visit to Australia.\n\n\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s William Hall collection.
