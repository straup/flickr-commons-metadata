All five ships were built in 1921-22 and the Commonwealth Government Line soon sold to the British Kylsant shipping Group! The most famous was the &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, sunk in a heroic action in WW2 (5 Nov 1940). The other four lasted until the mid 1950s. \nIt also seems to be the ship is not anchored but berthed, perhaps at one of the Walsh Bay wharves, and there is no sign of it being in festive dress as the Regatta flagship.", "authorname": "FredV45", "id": "33142378-8168667507-72157632305124547", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8168667507/#comment72157632689148061", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1360036687", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/39967544@N00] It's interesting you point that out FredV45 because a few other photographs in the same series had been mislabelled RMS MOLDAVIA as well.
