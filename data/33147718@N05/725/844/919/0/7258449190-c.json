In this pic the Brisbane River looks to be within  its normal tidal range, so it wasn't taken during the flood...and my hunch (guess!) is there's not enough mayhem evident for the pic to have been taken in the weeks and probably months following the 1893 floods. Hitherto I haven't quite given these pics of Brisbane the attention which is their due...but I suspect that if we dig around we might be able to  date pre and post 1893 flood pics via less substantial structures such as waterfront warehouses and sheds, which might not have survived major flooding...but I suspect flood dating will complicated by other floods...eg, the 1890, 1896  and 1898 floods...which although not in the same league as the 1893 floods were  still significant...as can be seen here <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/33147718@N05/7283001522/in/photolist-c6zhBL-bYcE5G-ckVpUA-bYPf8j-c2AjSb-c2zsFo-ckVqRY-bYcxLY-dLUjYk-cDJ2Td-c3oXdb-c4Xbfs-c3pEno-dMdrxt-bB2vMi-dBVZey-cEqGbo-crKU9N-e8j9Zq-e8eZEi-cvrEe7-cugkbf-cuZGFQ-cvtfns-cvt2FL-cugQUm-cuZCXL-cufLx7-cvYrwf-cvsc1s-cvYM6j-cugHsN-cvY7QU-c4qtem-c3SmpL-c3Sv6E-c3RtGh-c3eXZQ-c3eDJJ-c3QJH3-c4qmvm-dZNh9C-dggQK2-dRi2k5-bZmFFf-bZmVrS-bZmwG9-bZmjJh-c2xGEh-c2xZPf-c3eryy\">www.flickr.com/photos/33147718@N05/7283001522/in/photolis...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7258449190-72157634450021653", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7258449190/#comment72157634458711278", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1372826280", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/Image/DigitalImageView.aspx?ImageId=3071\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/Image/DigitalImageView.aspx...</a> ...this fantastic QSA panorama/wide angle shot shows the river level at the Brisbane Customs House during the 1893 floods.
