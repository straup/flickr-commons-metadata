Armed deputized American Company employees and Arizona Rangers are in the background. Governor Rafael Yzabel, the Governor of Sonora, is seated behind Greene to his left. This photograph is part of the Cananea, Mexico collection which includes 20 photographs of Cananea, Mexico located just across the Arizona border showing striking miners, armed men, demonstrations, the mine site, town views and American company employees. The workers' strike conflict is considered a key event in the general unrest that emerged during the final years of the regime of President Porfirio Diaz and that prefigured the Mexican Revolution of 1910.  \n\nPhysical Description: 1 photographic print: gelatin silver, black and white; 12.7 x 17.8 cm. \nFile: ag1983_0282_03_opt.tif \n\nFor more information, see: <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.smu.edu/u?/mex,171\" rel=\"nofollow\">digitalcollections.smu.edu/u?/mex,171</a>\n\nView Mexico: Photographs, Manuscripts, and Imprints at: <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.smu.edu/all/cul/mex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">digitalcollections.smu.edu/all/cul/mex/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3731", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1906-06-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382916762", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1276553045"}, "originalsecret": "f348fbc731", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4017", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smu_cul_digitalcollections/4701453220/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389685370}
