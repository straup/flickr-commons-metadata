Unfortunately, we have very little data as to where this photograph was taken. Based on what we were able to find, SKF supplied the Union Pacific Railroad with wheelsets, traction motors, and gearbox bearings for their trains during the 1930s. Given that the M-10000 model appears in two other photographs within our collection, both associated with SKF, it is likely this was a display model that was in SKF's possession for their contribution on the full-sized M-10000. Given that the M-10000 was delivered to the railroad in 1934, it is likely that this photograph was taken around that time-period, to help promote SFK bearings, piggybacking off of the publicity of the locomotive. That's about everything I've been able to find.
