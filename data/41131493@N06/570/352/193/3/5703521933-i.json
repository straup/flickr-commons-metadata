Shaffer World War II Photographs\nFile: gmcs128g.jpg \n\nDescription from Melvin C. Shaffer: The only photograph I kept of Dachau: the remains of an aircraft hangar just east of the compound. This was significant to me because we had used captured aircraft with US pilots to film the burning of Dachau. The two barracks buildings remaining there today were hosed down constantly as the main camp was burned. When we had finished this photography assignment, our two planes collided in mid-air. The one I was in lost about a third of one wing but, after a few terrifying maneuvers, was able to land and parked just where this photo was made. Being slightly injured in the exploit, I left immediately and was treated at the nearest US hospital in Nuremberg, from where I immediately left for Berlin. \n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
