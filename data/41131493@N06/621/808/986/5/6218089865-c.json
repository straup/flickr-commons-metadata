The Central Mexican joined M\u00e9xico City to Paso del Norte (Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) border to El Paso, Texas.   I am from Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila.   This railroad company reached my city on 1883 and when this hapened the line\nwas done. Five years later the International Mexican reached Torre\u00f3n causing the town to develop at gigant steps.  The line joined Ciudad Porfirio D\u00edaz (Piedras Negras), border to Eagle Pass, Tex. and Durango, M\u00e9xico.  The locomotive model seems to be from those years\nup to 1890. Today the place most likely might be Avenida de los Arcos and Boulevard Bernardo  Quintana, Quer\u00e9taro City (capital of the state of the same name), M\u00e9xico.\nDr. Roberto Duarte\nPlastic Surgeon\ndr.robertoduarte@hotmail.com", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "41086171-6218089865-72157628657942377", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6218089865"}, "flarchive:created": 1389684415}
