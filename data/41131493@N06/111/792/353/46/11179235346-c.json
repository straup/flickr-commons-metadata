Based on what you have given us, we were able to discover that the aircraft in the photograph is a Lockheed AT-18A-LO Hudson (L-414), serial number 42-055552. While most of the A-28 and A-29 models were split between the RAF and the USAF, based on our information, this is a model AT-18A which seems to have been used exclusively by the USAF for navigational training. Only 83 of this aircraft model were ever built.", "authorname": "SMU Central University Libraries", "id": "41086171-11179235346-72157638902602686", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "11179235346"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619983}
