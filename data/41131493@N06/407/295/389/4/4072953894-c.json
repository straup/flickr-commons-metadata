Jeff Davis was a West pointer before the war but never reached the rank of Maj. Gen in the Union. He also never saw action as a Maj. Gen in the Confederate army, instead being elected president before the war broke out.\nSo with that in mind this photo looks a bit confusing.\n\nWhen his native state of Mississippi seceeded from the Union 9th of Jan 1861, Davis resigned from his position as a Senator in the US Congress. (few days later).\nFour days after his resignation he was commissioned a Major General of Mississippi State Troops. Several weeks later on the 9th of Feb he was elected Provisional President of the C.S.A. \n\nHence the above photo, taken in 1861, depicts him in his very brief tenure as a Major General of Mississippi troops. The reason his uniform is blue rather than gray is due to the fact that in the very early days of the secession &amp; early war the uniforms had not yet been changed to the later Confederate Gray.", "authorname": "Fred Hall", "id": "41086171-4072953894-72157622785373578", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4072953894"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685533}
