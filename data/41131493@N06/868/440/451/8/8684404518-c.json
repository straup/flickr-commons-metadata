Based on what we were able to find, this model aircraft is a Keystone-Loening K-84 Commuter, first manufactured in 1929. Keystone-Loening was bought out by Curtiss-Wright and became one of their divisions in 1931, but stopped manufacturing altogether in 1932. This particular aircraft is still in existence, and has been listed as being housed at the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum, in Anchorage, Alaska. Thanks again for all your help in identifying these aircraft!", "authorname": "SMU Central University Libraries", "id": "41086171-8684404518-72157638903319326", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8684404518"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681096}
