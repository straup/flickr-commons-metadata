Ltd., Aruba]        \n\nCreator: Robert Yarnall Richie \n\nDate: September 1939\n\nPlace: Aruba\n\nDescription: Negatives from this series were accompanied by a typewritten letter: ''Aruba has been agog with 'rumors of war'. Being the worlds' largest refinery it supplies vast quantities of avation [sic] gasoline to England and France. Consequently apprehension is felt in the event of hostilities. The garrison of Dutch Marines have been greatly enlarged in the last week or so, to guard the hundreds of thousands of barrels of high octane gasoline, stored in Hortonspheroids against possible sabotage. This refinery is operated by the Lago Oil and Transport Co., Ltd. a subsidary [sic] of Standard Oil of New Jersey. Crude oil supplies for the refinery are drawn mainly from the new fields of eastern Venezuela, Lake Maracaibo fields and from Columbia [sic]. Gov. G.J.J. Wouters is in almost daily conference with Lloyd G. Smith general manager of the refinery on interesting matters pertaining to the protection of the refinery. There you have the story behind the enclosed films of a Dutch Marine on the lookout for possible sabotage.'' Excerpt from letter just recieved [sic] from Mr. Richie who is now in Venezuela photographing various phases of oil production there. September 1st 1939. \n\nPhysical Description: 1 negative film: black and white; 13 x 10 cm.    \n\nFile: ag1982_0234_2040_03l_aruba.tif          \n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
