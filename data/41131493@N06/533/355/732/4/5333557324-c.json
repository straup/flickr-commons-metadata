There were a good number employed in Mexico, generally on steeply-graded sections, from the early 1870s. This one appears to be one of the last, supplied in 1901 for FC Mexicano and built by the Neilson &amp; Co, Glasgow, Scotland.   Fairlie locomotives were very powerful for the times and one of the earliest articulated locomotive types, able to traverse winding track. The one depicted is oil fired (which must have been a relief to the fireman as the earlier ones were wood- and coal-burners!). Needless to say, the cab space was very limited - generally the driver would be on one side and the fireman the other.  In Mexico. the Fairlie type had over fifty years of service before being ousted by electrification. (The Ffestiniog railway in Wales still has a number of Fairlie locos, on narrow gauge.)
