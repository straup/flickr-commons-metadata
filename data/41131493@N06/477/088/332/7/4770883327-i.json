Jones III Texas photography collection\n\nDescription: The earliest known photograph of an execution in Texas was taken in Brownsville, Texas on June 22, 1866 by either Louis de Planque or R.H. Wallis. This view shows, from left to right, Vicente Garcia, Juan Vela and Florencio Garza standing on the gallows trap door just seconds before it was sprung. A large and unruly crowd attended the execution and mounted U.S. cavalryman, called upon to help maintain order, can be seen in the far background behind the gallows. Although other photographs of this event were taken, this single image is the only known original that is extant.\n\nPhysical Description: 1 photographic print on carte de visite mount; 10 x 6 cm. \nForm/Genre: Cartes de visite; Photographs; Portrait photographs\nFile: federal_army-1-06c.tif \n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
