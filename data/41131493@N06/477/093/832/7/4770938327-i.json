Jones III Texas photography collection\n\nDescription: This portrait of Robert Rodgers was taken in his Fort Brown prison cell shortly before his execution by hanging on June 11, 1866. Rodgers, a private in the 77th Ohio Infantry Regiment, was part of the Federal occupation forces stationed in Texas after the Civil War. Rodgers was serving at Fort Brown, Texas, when he was condemned for the brutal murder of a civilian sutler. The same gallows would be used eleven days later to hang three Mexican men, Florencio Garza, Juan Vela and Vicente Garcia, who were also condemned for murder. The photographer was likely to be Louis de Planque or R. H. Wallis.  \n\nPhysical Description: 1 photographic print on carte de visite mount; 10 x 6 cm. \nForm/Genre: Cartes de visite; Photographs; Portrait photographs\nFile: federal_army-1-07c.tif \n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
