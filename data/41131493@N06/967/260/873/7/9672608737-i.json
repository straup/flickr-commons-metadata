H. J. Phot. Co.\n\nDate: ca. 1892\n\nPart Of: Album of views of Arizona, New Mexico and the southwest, 1892\n\nDescription: This photograph is part of an album containing photographs of Arizona and New Mexico by William Henry Jackson, as well as photographs of San Antonio, Texas, by Mary E. Jacobson. In 1883, ''Captain'' John Hance became the first European American to settle at the Grand Canyon. He worked as a guide and hotel manager and had a reputation as an imaginative, eccentric, and highly entertaining storyteller. Hance improved an old Havasupai trail at the head of today's Hance Creek drainage shortly after his arrival, but it was subject to frequent washouts. When rockslides made the ''Old Hance Trail'' impassable, he built the New Hance Trail down Red Canyon.
