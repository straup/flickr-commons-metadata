These missions became the foundation for the city of San Antonio. ... The goal of the missions was to spread the Catholic faith among the native inhabitants and to serve as a buffer against expansion by foreign invaders. The missions were primarily religious centers where the Coahuiltecan Indian population was instructed in the Catholic religion and taught European beliefs.\n\n&quot;<b>Mission San Francisco de la Espada</b> is the southern-most of the San Antonio missions. The mission was established in 1731 and was used by James Bowie, William Travis and the Texas army as a stronghold against the Mexicans during Texas' struggle for independence. Ruins of the mission walls, a granary, a convento (missionary quarters) and a fortified tower also remain. The mission's kilns are the only known lime kilns in Texas that survive from the Spanish Colonial period. The mission has been rebuilt throughout its history and is currently being restored by the Archdiocese of San Antonio.&quot;\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>Mission San Francisco de la Espada &ndash; Then and Now</b> (100+ years later)\n\n&quot;Fourth Mission (1892) by <i>Mary Jacobson</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Mission Espada (2011)&quot; by <i>Ellen Yeates</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smu_cul_digitalcollections/8971699514/\" title=\"Fourth Mission by SMU Central University Libraries, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/8971699514_5fe9a618fe_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"148\" alt=\"Fourth Mission\" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyeates/5695996915/\" title=\"Mission Espada by Ellen Yeates, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3218/5695996915_0319ff323d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Mission Espada\" /></a>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "41086171-8971699514-72157634033749799", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8971699514"}, "flarchive:created": 1389687834}
