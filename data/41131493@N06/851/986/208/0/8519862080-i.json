Phila. &amp; NY\n\nDate Issued: ca. 1835\n\nVignette: (L) Hunter standing. (C) Mexican eagle, snake, and cactus. (R) Indian in canoe.\n\nNotes:  This private scrip was issued in Columbia by The Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas. In the lower-left corner of note is a vignette of a hunter standing in place. A Mexican golden eagle perched on a cactus and devouring a snake is depicted in the upper-center of the note. In the upper-right corner is a vignette of an Indian in a canoe. The note is denominated in dollars and pesos. The plate designation ''A'' appears in two locations along the top edge of the note. The Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas was the only bank ever authorized in Texas prior to the organization of National Banks in 1865. The bank was chartered to Samuel M. Williams by the Mexican Government on April 30, 1835. Because of charter requirements, the bank was never opened at Columbia although notes and other fiscal papers were prepared. The bank did open at Galveston in 1848 and did issue currency for a short time. Notes on the bank are rare, and the examples recorded were reconstructed from Louisiana notes of the CSA era which had been printed on the reverse. \n\nSignatures: [blank] Cash.'; [blank] Prest.\n\nDimensions: 8 x 18.5 cm. \n\nFile: BrazoriaColumbia0000009_opt.jpg\n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
