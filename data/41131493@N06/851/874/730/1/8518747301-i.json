Laid out in 1836 by Sam Houston and Philip A. Sublett, the city was first called City of Sabine. The name was changed to Sabine Pass in 1860. The left border of the note is ornately decorated. The amount ''$250.'' is printed at the top and bottom of the left border. In the center of the left border Liberty is seated in a roundel; a star is printed within a roundel above and below Liberty. The number ''250'' is printed in a rectangle design towards the upper-left and -right corners. The abbreviation ''No.'' is printed in the center of the top edge of the note; the number ''203'' is handwritten adjacent to it. A star appears in the center of the note; the phrase ''CERTIFICATE OF STOCK'' is printed above the star in a semi-circle design. A ship is printed to the left of the star; a train and car are printed to the right. The month and year are handwritten towards along the bottom of the note; the year, 1839, is printed adjacent to them. The note is signed on the recto by Niles F. Smith, Agent for Proprietors. An illegible signature appears on the verso. Smith was a medical doctor, farmer, political official, and merchant (TSHA). Smith was appointed the first bank examiner of the Republic of Texas by Sam Houston, served as notary public for Jefferson County, and was revenue collector for the Port of Sabine (Ibid.). In 1839 Smith, Houston, Sublett, and others organized the Sabine City Company, which sold titles to town lots (Dr. Niles Smith by W. T. Block). Smith held a number of roles as a businessman, including cotton broker and operator of a grocery store, drug store, liquor store, and bowling alley (Ibid.)\n\nSignatures: Recto: Niles f Smith Agent for Proprietors; Verso: [illegible]\n\nDimensions: 9 x 18 cm. \n\nFile: JeffersonSabine0000001_opt.jpg\n\nRights: Please cite Southern Methodist University, Central University Libraries, DeGolyer Library when using this image file.
