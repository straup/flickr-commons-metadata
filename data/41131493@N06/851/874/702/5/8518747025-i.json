Issued from September 1, 1837, through at least May 1840, these notes were a form of interest-bearing scrip in which the floating debt could be funded by the Republic. Elaborate printer designs border all edges of the note. The phrase ''PUBLIC FAITH PLEDGED.'' is printed along the left border, while the phrase ''ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.'' is printed in the right border. The abbreviation ''No.'' is printed in the upper-left and upper-right corners; the number ''2083'' is handwritten adjacent to each. The amount ''ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.'' is printed in a prominent font across the face of the note. The note is made payable to the President and Directors of the Bank of the State of Alabama. It is signed on the recto by Francis Richard Lubbock, Controller, and William Gordon Cooke, Stock Commissioner. Lubbock was a comptroller of the Republic of Texas as well as governor of the state beginning in 1861 (TSHA). Cooke was a soldier who held numerous positions in the military, including that as Houston's assistant inspector general, as well as stock commissioner during Houston's first term as president of the Republic, at which time Cooke was responsible for issuing stock certificates to fund the public debt (TSHA). From June 1837 to November 1839, Cooke was the official signer of Sam Houston's name to promissory notes issued by the Republic due to Houston's arm injury (TSHA).
