It didn't have normal cylinders at the front, but four 'steam motors', one for each main axle. The engine was never used in normal service and came in 1945 to the USA. After some experimental work with the then still very modern steam motors it was demolished in the fifties. The German Federal Railways were not interested in buying it back.", "authorname": "Maurits van den Toorn", "id": "41086171-8119863241-72157631912235465", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8119863241"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682331}
