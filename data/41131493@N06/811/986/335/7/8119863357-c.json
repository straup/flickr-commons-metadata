Alomst 300 were built between 1930 and 1938 by Borsig, Krupp, Henschel and Schwarzkopff as part of the great standardization programme of the DRG. The 03 193 in this picture is the only one of the 03 class streamline that got an experimental streamline outfit, which was painted dark red. The normal version ran in West-Germany until 1972.", "authorname": "Maurits van den Toorn", "id": "41086171-8119863357-72157631912681838", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8119863357"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682324}
