At high speeds (120 or even 130 km/h) the two cylinders caused a very shaky ride, so for higer speeds a three cylinder version was designed. In combination with the streamlining they could run up to a speed of 150 km/h. In the late thirties 55 engines were built; more than 200 were ordered, but production was halted at the outbreak of the Second World War in september 1939. All these engines ended up in the western part of Germany, where they ran as 'normal' engines, i.e. without the streamlining, until 1975 with the Deutsche Bundesbahn (Federal Railways). About ten of them still exist in various railway museums in Germany and the Netherlands. One of them got its streamlining back.", "authorname": "Maurits van den Toorn", "id": "41086171-8119876204-72157631912127469", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8119876204"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682322}
