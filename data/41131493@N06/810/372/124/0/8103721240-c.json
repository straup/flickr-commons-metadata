The 41 - later 041 - class of standard steam engines of the late thirties. More than 360 were built between 1938 and 1942; many more were ordered, but the war stopped further production. A universal engine that was widely used for passenger and freight trains. This type ran until 1975 with the Deutsche Bundesbahn (the West-German Federal Railways) and, heavily reconstructed, until 1988 with the Deutsche Reichsbahn (the East-German Railways). Some are still in use with railway museums in Germany and the Netherlands.", "authorname": "Maurits van den Toorn", "id": "41086171-8103721240-72157631912377375", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8103721240"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682353}
