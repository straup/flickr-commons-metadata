They were the first to centrifugally continuously cast  pipe.\n [ I worked in the third and fourth steel mills to install continuous casting of billets in N. America].\n First was Atlas Specialty Steels of Welland, Ont. &amp; Tracy, Que., 2nd was the Chiquaqua plant in Mexico. 3rd was Premier Steel, Edmonton, and 4th was a tie between Lake Ontario Steel, Whitby, and an American mill, Conner's Steel in Birmingham Alabama. Continuous casting raises the product finished yeild up from the mid 80's % in to the low to mid 90's %., which really pumps the profit margins. But all of that has been lost with the escalating energy prices!
