I did whatever was necessary -- feed the chickens, clean the coop, vaccinate chickens, grade the eggs on a scale. My father died suddenly, he couldn't get used to the work.\n\nHe owned a department store in Germany. I was 13 when I came to US. Mother worked in the store. I went to a regular school. Not too many Jewish kids there. We left in 1937. We were excluded couldn't do to much anymore. I couldn't do activities- I couldn't go out during the day. My father had cousins in Norwich who had a department store. We learned some English in Germany. We went to private school in Germany. My mother and grandmother kept the chicken farm until they got their restitution.&quot;\n\n<em>Collection of The Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford</em>\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
