As I understand it, the city of Orihuela has alternately belonged at various time in its history to either the province of Murcia and the province of Alicante. I believe the title above is based on an original inscribed or printed description found on the photograph. In any event, I think it is a terrific photograph, and one of my favorite by this artist.
