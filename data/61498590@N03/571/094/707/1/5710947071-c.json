I couldn't say which is correct, or that either is incorrect. I have looked at our photograph, and it appears as we've displayed it above. I should point out that our photograph is a 1905 photogravure print from Camera Work Magazine. The George Eastman House photograph is a salted paper print from the 1840s, presumably printed under the artists' supervision. I understand from comments on the George Eastman House flickr stream that their digital image is also oriented correctly with regard to their photograph. It should be remembered that whenever a photograph is printed from a negative, there is a possibility of the negative being flipped, thereby reversing the printed image.", "authorname": "Museum of Photographic Arts Collections", "id": "61475536-5710947071-72157628841435395", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "5710947071"}}
