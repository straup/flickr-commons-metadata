The photograph appears to show the second bridge constructed over Dale Creek (near Laramie, Wyoming) for the Union Pacific Railroad. This iron bridge was constructed in 1876, to replace the original 1868 wooden structure. What we find particularly interesting about this photograph--besides the very delicate appearance of this immense structure--is that it shows two men standing on the wires beneath the tracks in the middle of the bridge...over 100 feet above the creek bed!", "authorname": "Museum of Photographic Arts Collections", "id": "61475536-5711515556-72157629045205747", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "5711515556"}}
