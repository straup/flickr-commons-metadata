By 1941 the membership of over 500 enjoyed a full agenda of programs including classes, discussion groups, debate, drama and social activities. The lack of a permanent home was an issue as early as 1943, and the UJFC sanctioned a fund drive in 1945. A permanent building (the current one) was purchased in 1956. Even without a home, activities included a model Seder, Friday night services and dinners, and activities, such as vocational guidance, for returning veteran students.  The Seder in the photo was held during the early 1940s at the Tau Delta Phi house, a fraternity originally founded by Jews in New York in 1914.\n\n<b>Date:</b> 1942\n<b>Source:</b> 8 x 10\n<b>Format:</b> Black and white amateur photo\n<b>Subject:</b> Social issues; Women's Organizations--Miscellaneous\n<b>Coverage:</b> Minneapolis; Hennepin; Minnesota; United States\n<b>Local Identifier:</b> MHS562\n<b>Link to our record:</b> <a href=\"http://reflections.mndigital.org/u?/jhs,507\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reflections.mndigital.org/u?/jhs,507</a>\n\nFrom the Steinfeldt Photography Collection of the <a href=\"http://www.jhsum.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Historical Society of the Upper Midwest</a>."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2186", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1942-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1270601511", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1268120976"}, "originalsecret": "eb2e33368e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4069", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhsum-commons/4418772343/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
