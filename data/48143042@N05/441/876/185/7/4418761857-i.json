Isadore Gordon left Lithuania and traversed Canada before arriving in Duluth.  He worked in the shipyards, and peddled the Range.  His customer liked him so well that they loaned him money to open a clothing store in Ely.  In the picture, Leona--Isadore's sister-in-law-- and her daughter Anita-- are in the backyard of the Mike Gordon's Ely store: the steps in the background lead to the family home upstairs.  Mrs. Rosenbloom, another Jewish Ely resident, is at the right of the picture.  The Rosenblooms raised seven children in Ely, and most of them continued on to college at the University of Minnesota.  When the Rosenblooms moved to Minneapolis in 1943, the family store became the Ely American Legion Hall.\n\n<b>Date:</b> 1921?\n<b>Source:</b> 9 cm x 12.5 cm\n<b>Format:</b> Black and white original photo\n<b>Subject:</b> Business and industry; Portraits; Gordon, Leona; Gamson, Anita Gordon\n<b>Coverage:</b> Ely; St. Louis; Minnesota; United States\n<b>Local Identifier:</b> P-23\n<b>Link to our record:</b> <a href=\"http://reflections.mndigital.org/u?/jhs,410\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reflections.mndigital.org/u?/jhs,410</a>\n\nFrom the Steinfeldt Photography Collection of the <a href=\"http://www.jhsum.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Historical Society of the Upper Midwest</a>."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1715", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1921-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1270601471", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1268120531"}, "originalsecret": "874155f56e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2784", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhsum-commons/4418761857/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
