Nye, Dry and Fancy Goods shop, on Centre Street, with Mary posed in the doorway, c. 1880s.\n\nIn the early and middle years of the 19th century, the preponderance of women merchants, selling everything from daily necessities to exotic goods, gave Centre Street the nickname &quot;Petticoat Row.&quot; Generally, in the 19th century, women's roles became increasingly confined to the home as the shortage of male labor was overcome. But on Nantucket, whaling husbands were away for long stretches\u2014 as long as five years\u2014and the dangers of whaling often left women widows.
