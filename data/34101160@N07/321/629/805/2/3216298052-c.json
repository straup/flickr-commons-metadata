The most famous Lightship was the South Shoal Lightship. Located about 60 miles south of the Island,  It was there that many famous makers made their best baskets.  Many basket makers had a &quot;production-line&quot; that turned the bottoms, wove the staves, and finished the baskets while serving aboard.  Some of the best baskets were sold to the tourists that visited the many hotels and boarding houses.  During this period up to eight baskets were expertly assembled into fitted &quot;nests&quot;.  Prices started at about $1.50 for the smallest basket and could go up to about $50.00 for a nest of eight.&quot; <i>--<a href=\"http://www.nantucketlightshipbasketmuseum.org/Baskets.html\"> Nantucket Lightship Basket Museum</a></i>\n\nExtra income was welcome, as the men were only paid $600 for eight months of work.\n\n&quot;The Round Nantucket&quot; by <i>NLBM</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.nantucketlightshipbasketmuseum.org/Baskets.html\"><img src=\"http://www.nantucketlightshipbasketmuseum.org/Image/Basket-Illustration.gif\" width=\"200\" alt=\"The Round Nantucket\" alt=\"The Round Nantucket\" /></a>\n\nNantucket baskets have always made wonderful gifts! The Nantucket Basket's labor-intensive construction is characterized by several distinctive features. They are hand woven using rattan or cane onto wooden molds with wooden bases. The Nantucket &quot;purses&quot; are decorated with carved or scrimshawed pieces.
