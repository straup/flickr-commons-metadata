Roy Kitchen (on the right - banjo) is my father. Indeed he married and moved Tweed - he worked for Trudeau Motors. He died in 1955 leaving my Brother, my Mother and myself. John and I are now retired and back in Tweed. I never heard much of his music (I was too young) although I still have that banjo he is holding.\nThanks for the memory\nJim", "authorname": "49IHC", "id": "23100052-2925376328-72157623195282026", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/2925376328/#comment72157623071500589", "realname": "Deseronto Archives", "path_alias": "deserontoarchives", "author": "23121382@N07", "iconserver": "3831", "datecreate": "1263312595", "_content": "Jim - I'm so pleased that you found the photo.
