Since this photograph was taken the traps player, James McVicker, has added a set of temple blocks to his equipment.

This source also informs us that the band was in existence between 1927 and 1932. James McVicker was the Fire Chief for the town of Deseronto and also the town's postmaster, between 1932 and 1970.\n\nReginald Dawson's saxophone has been <a href=\"http://bassic-sax.info/blog/?p=21167\" rel=\"nofollow\">identified</a> as a Conn C melody with a straight neck."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3738", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1927-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376526839", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1223498086"}, "originalsecret": "49ed021053", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3257", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/2925376328/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389189400}
