This was a French build Scout/Fighter of World War 1. It was Manufactured by the French Aircraft Company Societe Pour L'Aviation et ses Derives (SPAD). This Aircraft can be identified as a SPAD 13 rather than the SPAD 7 due to the presents of 2 Vickers machine guns seen on the top of the engine cowl in recessed pits, the SPAD 7 had but a single machine gun. This aircraft type was used extensively by the French Airforce during the War producing such ACES like the famous Georges Guynemer (SPAD 7/13) and was flown and equiped the American famous Lafayette Escadrille Squadron, which is why or likely why this aircraft found its way to Camp Rathbun.", "authorname": "petemillair", "id": "23100052-5492019945-72157630512865656", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/5492019945/#comment72157630637172744", "realname": "Deseronto Archives", "path_alias": "deserontoarchives", "author": "23121382@N07", "iconserver": "3831", "datecreate": "1342623864", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/82338888@N06] Thanks for the clarification!", "authorname": "Deseronto Archives", "id": "23100052-5492019945-72157630637172744", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5492019945"}, "flarchive:created": 1389186966}
