It is actually quite some time after the end of the great war. The high wing monoplane is a Lockheed Vega, one of the most advanced machines at that time (1927) designed by a team of which the brilliant Jack Northrop was a member.\n\nAlthough I am not able to view this exactly but given the star on the rudder in combination with the engine without NACA ring and the seemingly dark colour of the machine, this might be the first machine (prototype) of 1927.\n\nThe location is distinctive and somebody out there can presumably pinpoint it down correctly. My best guess is Hollywood where the first plant of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation was located.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "23100052-3721969691-72157630843834476", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/3721969691/#comment72157630854487504", "realname": "Deseronto Archives", "path_alias": "deserontoarchives", "author": "23121382@N07", "iconserver": "3831", "datecreate": "1343833149", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/varese2002] Wonderful, thanks for the extra information!", "authorname": "Deseronto Archives", "id": "23100052-3721969691-72157630854487504", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3721969691"}, "flarchive:created": 1389188046}
