Lands to the east of the Mohawks' reserve were patented by John Culbertson in 1837. He began selling village lots in his tract in 1840. Culbertson registered a survey for a village, &quot;Deseronca&quot;, in 1850, although the settlement was called &quot;Mill Point&quot; 1850-81. After Hugo B. Rathbun acquired many village properties and built one of the province's earliest &quot;company towns&quot; here to house employees of his shipyard and sawmill. A county by-law of 1871 provided for the incorporation of Mill Point as a Village. It was renamed &quot;Deseronto&quot; in 1881 and became a Town in 1888.\n\nErected by the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board, Department of Public Records and Archives of Ontario.\n\nDate and Time: Saturday, June 19th, 2:00 p.m.\nSpeakers:\nChairman: Father C.
