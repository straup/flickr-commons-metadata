Arrange to bring your families to see it, no matter whether you require anything or not. Just come along and have a look, and if it does not make you hungry to see so many nice things ready for the oven it won't be our fault. Owing to our increased trade, and anticipating an immense rush of thousands of new customers during Christmas week, we are now trying to make arrangements with Mr. Baker to add another hundred feet on to his already fine block.\n\nSome of our customers are buying their turkeys now, and eating them too, so that they will not be left when the rush comes.\n\nDo not be afraid - we will have enough for all. Only give us your order now and not have to wait, as we were only able to secure the services of a few less than fifteen men to serve you on Dec. 24th. So come one and all and see the great Christmas Fair.\n\n<strong>ADMISSION FREE</strong>\n\nTHE BAY OF QUINTE MEAT CO'Y\n\nBaker Block, Deseronto"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3171", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1892-12-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1386782705", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1258726862"}, "originalsecret": "36597c10d9", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2581", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/4119942552/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389187515}
