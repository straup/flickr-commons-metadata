The year is not given, but four possibilities arise (given the days of the week and the fact that the jeweller, Gerald Lott was born in 1919): 1949, 1955, 1960 and 1966. There were other productions of this show around the world in 1955, so perhaps this year is the most likely. \n\nThanks to our commenter for confirming that it was indeed performed in 1955."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "6541", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 90, "dates": {"taken": "1955-11-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1377182984", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1226761171"}, "originalsecret": "b554d85caf", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3164", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/3032208732/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389189199}
