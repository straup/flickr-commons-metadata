This is the CPR wharf at Sault Ste. Marie, where the ships scheduled to layover, backed into the slip. I believe this is the pier now occupied by Purvis Marine, just west of the Bush-plane Heritage Museum. \n\nA photo of the Keewatin on the cover of the book Railway Steamships of Ontario, by Dana Ashdown, Boston Mills Press 1988, shows the ship moored along the front of this pier. Also shown on page 252, the author guessed it was at Port Arthur, however similar scenes published in Inland Seas, identify it as Sault Ste Marie and the elevation on the photo suggests it was taken from a passing ship, exiting from the Canadian lock. In the Ashdown photo, the masts and stack can be seen of a ship moored in the slip, while to the left of Keewatin's funnel, can be seen the roof the same structure seen at the left of this picture.", "authorname": "Wrecksdale Wreck", "id": "23100052-3730329155-72157622098956606", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/3730329155/#comment72157622100599902", "realname": "Deseronto Archives", "path_alias": "deserontoarchives", "author": "23121382@N07", "iconserver": "3831", "datecreate": "1250850500", "_content": "Thanks Wrecksdale - I was sure that someone would be able to help with identifying this location.", "authorname": "Deseronto Archives", "id": "23100052-3730329155-72157622100599902", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/3730329155/#comment72157622572114113", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jamica1", "author": "35607158@N06", "iconserver": "5479", "datecreate": "1256927141", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1300443@N22/\">History of Canadian Science and Technology</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "jamica1", "id": "23100052-3730329155-72157622572114113", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3730329155"}, "flarchive:created": 1389187972}
