The piston on this portable engine only drives the flywheel, to power the cable that is lifting the coal hopper from the hold of the ship. The man sitting at the left looks like he is operating the cable hoisting machinery that the steam engine is powering. At the front of the boiler is the Tongue (diagonal post) attached to its front axle, to which a team of horses can be attached for moving the boiler to various locations. Unlike a &quot;traction engine&quot; there was no power from the steam engine to its wooden wheels. There was a seat attached to the smokebox in front of the flywheel, to accomodate the teamster. Portables like this were very common in Ontario, Haggert's foundry in Brampton built hundreds just like this one.\n\nThe trucks into which the coal is being loaded, is actually a railway flat car with wooden walls attached to its side stake pockets. Possibly a BQR flat car.", "authorname": "Wrecksdale Wreck", "id": "23100052-3731031388-72157622088643226", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/3731031388/#comment72157621967962031", "realname": "Deseronto Archives", "path_alias": "deserontoarchives", "author": "23121382@N07", "iconserver": "3831", "datecreate": "1250772334", "_content": "Thank you so much for all this information: priceless!", "authorname": "Deseronto Archives", "id": "23100052-3731031388-72157621967962031", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3731031388"}, "flarchive:created": 1389187990}
