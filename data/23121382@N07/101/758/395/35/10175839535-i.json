Episode II describes the Landing of the Mohawks.\n\nEpisode III contained the &quot;Dance of the Wilderness Spirit&quot; followed by &quot;Conquering the Barriers&quot;, &quot;A symbolic portrayal of the heroic advancement of the Pioneer Manhood and Pioneer Womanhood of Canada in the face of Obstacles and the opposing forces of Nature. The Forest harboring many lurking dangers had to be cleared away. Floods from the Rivers had to be subdued. Mists from the swamp lands brought on Fever, and following closely came Famine, with Death itself stalking always in the shadows. Yet the advancement of the early Manhood and Womanhood of Canada have been crowned with the noble triumphs reflected in the Deseronto of today.&quot;\n\nEpisode IV describes the &quot;Coming of the U.
