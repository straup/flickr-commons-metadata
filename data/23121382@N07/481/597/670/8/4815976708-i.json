The current owner would be interested to learn more about the history of this vehicle. Please comment if you know anything about it.\n\nUPDATE: The vehicle was not used as an ambulance while in Deseronto, but as a general workhorse-type vehicle for the Fire Department. It was in use in the 1970s in the town and &quot;Went well, when we could get it to start&quot;, according to Ralph Lawlor, one of its former drivers!"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "572", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1975-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1367350354", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1279733708"}, "originalsecret": "4c3c3df8cb", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4102", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/4815976708/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389187231}
