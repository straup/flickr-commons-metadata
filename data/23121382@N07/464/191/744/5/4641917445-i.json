A pencilled note next to the photograph in the album reads &quot;John See &amp; family&quot;.\n\nThis is one of a set of photographs found in a photograph album donated to the Archives by Aaron Baptiste in 2010.\n\nThe 1900 census for the USA reports a John and Mary See living in North Carlisle, Pembina, North Dakota, aged 46 and 43, respectively. This family had seven children: William (23), Annie (20), James (17), Thomas (13), Richard (11), Grace (8) and Allice May (2). If this is the family pictured here, then the baby is probably Grace and the picture would date from c.1893. Mary was born in England and John in Canada. In the 1920 census, John was a widower and retired farmer, living with Grace (27, home manager) and May (21, bank teller). John came to the USA in 1886, according to this census. Mary had died before 1910.\n\nIn 1881, John, Mary and their two eldest children were in Richmond Township, Lennox, Ontario (now part of Greater Napanee). \n\nInformation from Eric and Linda Wilde: John See was the son of Samuel See (1808-1854) and Mary Martin (1808-1897). He was born in 1854 in Lennox and Addington. His parents were born in England."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1358", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1893-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1367350352", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1274893862"}, "originalsecret": "4eb14772de", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4036", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/deserontoarchives/4641917445/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389187267}
