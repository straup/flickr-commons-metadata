Four afternoons a week from 4:00-5:30 27 Moslem boys come to the little mission school to learn to read &amp; write.  These are boys who were not able to enroll in public school, either because there was no room for them or they had never before gone to school and are now too far behind their age group to begin.  Robert Stetter is the teacher.  Here Jean Claude Muller, a French Mennonite stationed with the armuy in Algeria, helps with teaching during his free time.\n\nCitation: Mennonite Board of Missions.
