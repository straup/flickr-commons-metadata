How cool that you've been to this area!  Mennonite work in India was concentrated in a few areas, Bihar being one of them.  Bihar was actually a mission field for the Missionary Church (formerly the United Missionary Church, formerly the Mennonite Brethren in Christ), so we don't have a lot of records about Bihar.  We have far more holdings about work in Madhya Pradesh.", "authorname": "Mennonite Church USA Archives", "id": "52483732-5487227432-72157627608711072", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5487227432"}, "flarchive:created": 1389689476}
