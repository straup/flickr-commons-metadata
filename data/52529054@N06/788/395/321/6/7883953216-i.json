So we planned for everybody to be seated in the east, west and north stands, or on the south end grass. Soon, though the cold winds on the east side drove them down to the more sheltered and warmer turf area. We could not stop them. Our friend, the Stadium Operations Manager, Rod Thiessen, first closed one eye, then both, and we let it happen. Eventually a mass of people on the turf formed a bridge between the widely separated stands. We had physically become one. But even more significantly, we had through the week and on this Sunday morning become one in the Spirit. I was reminded of the song we sang in 1984 at Strasbourg: &quot;In Christ there is no East or West, in Him no South or North; But one great fellowship of love Throughout the whole wide earth. In Him shall true hearts everywhere There high communion find His service is the golden cord Close binding all mankind.&quot;\n\nCitation: Mennonite World Conference.
