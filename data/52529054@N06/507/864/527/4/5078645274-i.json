There are four known Mennonite men in the photo (Back row, third from right: Elmer McTimmmonds, lived near Sheridan, Oregon; back row, fourth from right: John Kropf, lived near Harrisburg, Oregon; middle row, fourth from right: Homer Schlegel, lived in Albany, Oregon; middle row, far right: Orie M. Conrad, later lived near Albany, Oregon) Orie refused to train and refused to put on a uniform. He paid dearly for it. At one point he almost lost his life by hanging but an officer saved him and his tormentors were court-martialed.\n\nCan you identify other conscientious objectors in this photo?  If so, please leave a comment below.\n\nOrie M. Conrad Photographs, HM4-384. Mennonite Church USA Archives-Goshen.
