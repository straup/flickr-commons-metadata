Camp Ebenezer was a fresh air camp in Holmes County, Ohio.  It was founded in 1947 by Tillie Yoder, a young woman who grew up Amish but joined the Mennonite Church rather than becoming Amish herself.  Yoder became aware of the pain of racial segregation when her African American friend, Ada Webb, was denied entry into Eastern Mennonite College.  The two women attended Hessten College, where they were roommates.  Tillie Yoder opened the camp out of her conviction that all people are equal in God's eyes.", "authorname": "Mennonite Church USA Archives", "id": "52483732-4843741076-72157634099656505", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4843741076"}, "flarchive:created": 1389690377}
