In the beginning of November, every year a school of eel came up with river. Almost every man in town dips for eel while there is time. This year there was an exceptional large catch. The men dip with nets, which came up full of writhing eels. Quickly they are poured on the ice, where they wriggle until the cold catches up with them. The men follow the eels a way up the river since they move about 1 or 2 miles an hour. These eels provide dog food for the winter.\n\nCitation: Mennonite Board of Missions. Photographs.
