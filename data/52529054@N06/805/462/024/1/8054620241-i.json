This place was a concentratiion camp under the Nazis when they controlled Trieste; prrior to that this building  was a factory.  Around 4,000 refugees lived in this building,  They were expelled from Yugoslavia because they refused to accept Yugoslavian  citizenship.  A large majority of these were white Russians who had found refuge in Yogoslavia in the years after the revolution, but were now finding themselves in the same situation that they fled from some years earlier.  It was in this large building that a meeting of around 600 assembled to hear the Gospel.\n\nCitation: Mennonite Board of Missions. Photos.   Belgium Mission, 1945-1960.
