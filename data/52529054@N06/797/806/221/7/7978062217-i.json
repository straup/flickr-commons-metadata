Our Pax experience has been filled with many extras - Palestine Pilgrimage, Peace Conference, study seminar - largely through the initiative and creative direction of Ray. When the passing of years has dimmed the more vivid memories of our service with Pax we will recall with thankfulness, as we leaf through these pages, that the experiences which were ours were made richer through the efforts Ray extended in our behalf. Signed, every Paxmen.\n\nCitation: PAX Collection, 1945-2006. Isabel Gingrich Glanzer 1959 Scrapbook. HM1-927 Box 3 Folder 4 photo 1. Mennonite Church USA Archives - Goshen.
