From the caption: The boys dormitories, baths, a small sewing room, and Sister Pinyro's room are in the right wing. In the center is the dining room and kitchen and in the left wing are the rooms of the Siebers. The windmill, which you can see in the background, pumps water into a tank on top of the building. Thus there is cold, running water in the kitchen and baths. The view from the orphanage is from the front yard or park as it is called here. The lawn is cut up with paths, leaving small spaces in geometrical designs where grass, shrubbery, and flowers are planted. There are thirteen designs, as you see in the picture, in front of the &quot;Home&quot;. The pictures, however, is taken at such an angle that you can see only one triangle. \n\nCitation: Mennonite Board of Missions, 1882-2002.
