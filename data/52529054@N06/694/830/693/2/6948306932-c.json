The Mennonite Church USA Archives is a repository of historical documents and photographs.  The photographs we post are therefore old.  The date on this photograph is indicated in the caption (1957), and we make no claim that this is a contemporary photograph.  As we continue to digitize our photo collection, you will see newer photographs of the Toba people on our Flickr site.  Please be patient, however -- we have tens of thousands of photographs to digitize!\n\nRegarding the racism inherent in this photograph, I am very sorry that this image is hurtful to you.  The Mennonite Church USA is committed to undoing racism and the pain it causes.  By identifying the racism inherent in this photograph, you have contributed to this important work.  Thank you.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nMennonite Church USA Archives", "authorname": "Mennonite Church USA Archives", "id": "52483732-6948306932-72157631111655788", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6948306932"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685283}
