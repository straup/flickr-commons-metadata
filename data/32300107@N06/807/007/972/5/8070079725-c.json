He was 5ft 5 and half inches tall when he attested 10 days after his 19th birthday (11th January 1916), It looks like he'd waited until he was old enough and joined pretty much as soon as he was old enough. Once trained he was sent to the DLI on 29th April 1916. John lived at 2 Walker Street, Scholes, Cleckheaton with his parents and younger brother Harry who was about 15. John was a butcher by trade. His records indicate he was in posted &quot;to base&quot; 25th July 1916, also known as the reserve and then posted to France on 7th August 1916 and was &quot;wounded&quot; 16th September 1916, 'wounded' can cover a multitude of sins. he was in France for 54 days before being killed.\n\nThe 20th DLI or  &quot;Wearside Pals&quot; were part of the 123rd Brigade, 41st Division. As such they were part of the &quot;New Army&quot; or &quot;Kitcheners Army&quot;. Young lads usually joining up together in a the heat of nationalistic fervour, then murdered together in a muddy field.\n\nHis mother Annie picked up his dues, pay and separation on 11th November 1916 from York. His life in cold hard cash owed was worth a total seven shillings and fourpence...\n\nHis father Wilf, received his personal effects via the War office on 10th May 1917. This sadly indicates that his body would probably have been found on his wounding or death, but lost in the later fighting.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly where he died, but I'd place even money on it being in the Flers area, where the infantry of the  41st Division attacked alongside tanks from 15th September 1916.", "authorname": "Nick J Stone", "id": "32254785-8070079725-72157631729065440", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8070079725/#comment72157631731814707", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77788549@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1349804545", "_content": "20th (Service) Battalion Durham Light Infantry landed in France at Le Havre on 5th May 1916.  John Butterworth was almost certainly posted out to join the Battalion as a battle casualty replacement in August 1916, he would have gone out with a small number of other DLI badged replacements to bring the battalion back up to strength.  After the shocking casualties amongst other 'Pals' battalions on the Somme in July (41st Division was not committed to the early phases of the Battle) the batches of reinforcements were no longer regionally based and a West Yorkshireman from Cleckheaton might not have had much in common with the 'Macams' from Wearside in 20th Durhams.\n\n123rd Brigade consisted:  11 Queen's; 10 Royal West Kent's; 23 Middlesex; and 20 DLI.  This Brigade, as mentioned above, was first committed to battle at Flers-Courcelettes in 15-22 September 1916.  Despite initial success through use of tanks, the attack lost momentum and stalled when it encountered German defences in depth behind Flers, and was called off on 22nd September.", "authorname": "Trench-Foote", "id": "32254785-8070079725-72157631731814707", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8070079725/#comment72157631732265094", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osborne_villas", "author": "73313451@N00", "iconserver": "3822", "datecreate": "1349808156", "_content": "Steve Smith has located the 20th DLI to just North of the Village on the 16th, &quot;consolidating&quot; the village, so a reasonably clear picture despite the mist of time.
