The Battalion had already seen action on the Somme during the Battle of Albert at La Boiselle; in the attacks on High Wood; and during the Battles for Pozierres and the Ancre Heights.  This final act in the Battle of the Somme, the attack into German positions astride the Ancre tributary was made across waterlogged ground, pounded by artillery and defended in depth.\n\n10th Battalion East Lancashires was a Reserve battalion, holding trained reinforcements in the UK.
