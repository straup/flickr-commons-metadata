My posting also crossed with Paul Johnson's , so wasn't aware of the Catton Hall connection.\n\nFollowing that up, it looks like a Colonel George Henry Anson, MC, TD, of Catton Hall, Burton, was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1941.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Derbyshire\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Derbyshire</a>\n\nThere certainly seems to be a New Zealand connection - the Catton Hall page on the Intenet has this in the history of the building:-\n\nAfter Anne Beatrix's death in 1871, Catton was looked after briefly by her two surviving sons and then by a grand-daughter, Augusta Theresa, married to the Reverend Arthur Henry Anson who built the present Chapel. It was their son, Henry Anson-Horton, who inherited Catton at the end of the 19th century. He returned from serving in the Colonial Office with his wife, Katie, and their family, and lived at Catton until 1925 when their eldest son, George. the first son to inherit directly from his father for some 200 years, took over. George looked after Catton from 1925 until 1957. In 1956,having no son and due to ill-health, he sent for his nephew, David Neilson, who returned with his family from New Zealand to take on the estate.\n<a href=\"http://www.catton-hall.com/uploads/Catton\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.catton-hall.com/uploads/Catton</a> History.pdf\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catton_Hall\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catton_Hall</a>\n\nOn the 1891 census the 2 year old George Henry, born Christchurch, New Zealand, was recorded at an unnamed building near St Giles Church in the civil parish of Marston Montgomery, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marston_Montgomery\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marston_Montgomery</a>\n\nHead of the household is Henry Anson, aged 37, who gives his occupation as Colonial Civil Service.. He was born Potter Hanworth, Lincolnshire. His wife, Katherine Clara, was then aged 35 and was originally from Trinidad in the West Indies.As well as George Henry, they have a daughter, Theresa Maud, (aged 4 and born Cavendish Square, London), and another son, Eustace Arthur, (aged 1 and born Catton, Derbyshire). Making up the household is a cook, a nurse, a nursemaid and a parlour maid.\n\nGeorge, Theresa and his parents don't appear to be on the 1901 census for England and Wales under the surname Anson. They don't appear on the census for Scotland either.  His brother Eustace, then aged 11, and recorded as born Croxall, Staffordshire, was listed at a Boarding School, Tower House, Tower Hill, Dorking in Surrey. I must admit I was expecting to find George in a similar establishment.\n\nHowever a search under the surname Horton, finds the family living at East Close, Christchurch, nr Southampton. Father Henry Anson Horton, (aged 47), is still recorded as a Colonial Civil Servant. Along with wife Katherine, there are three children and 10 servants. The three children are all new arrivals from the 1891 census:-\nMaud F A..............aged 10...............born London\nJoan.....................aged 6.................born Bonehill, Tamworth, Staffs\nNigel....................aged 3.................born Bonehill, Tamworth, Staffs\n\nGeorge's location as a visitor on the 1911 census has already been mentioned. His parents don't appear to be on the census under either name.\n\nYounger brother Nigel was to fall in the Great War.
