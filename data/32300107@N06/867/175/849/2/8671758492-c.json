On the Somme in July 1916, 1st/9th Highland Light Infantry was in 100th Brigade in 33rd Division.\n\nPrivate Barrie was probably killed in the fighting for the tangled mess of blasted tree stumps that was formerly High Wood.  After two days of ferocious close quarters battle under heavy artillery fire, the British found that they could not take a strongly prepared German position known as the Switch Line which ran through the remains of the northern apex of High Wood. With around two-thirds of the wood now captured, reinforcements were sent up on 15th July, including men from the 1/9 Highland Light Infantry (Glasgow Highlanders).  See Second Lieutenant William Kelly Carmichael Ogg of 9th Battalion Highland Light Infantry elsewhere in this portfolio, killed on the same day.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8671758492-72157633396043629", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8671758492/#comment72157633404239799", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1367706925", "_content": "Is it this Private William J Barrie who is commemorated on the Catrine and District war memorial in Ayrshire? - Possibly of 3 Ardrossan, New Ardrossan, Ayrshire, born 1896, son of William Barrie b. 1867, a Rail Guard from Lanarkshire, and Catherine S Barrie, b. 1868.
