He was a clever artist, and designed Nelson's funeral car. He was one of the pioneers of the use of gas as an illuminant, and endeavoured to utilize the balloon for the dissemination of literature. The old name is still well represented by his descendant, Mr. Edgar C. Ackermann, who now carries on at 191 Regent Street the business, started in 1825, as a branch of the original house in the Strand. Mr. E. C. Ackermann is the great-grandson of Mr. R.

The family name is transcribed as \u201cAckerman\u201d on the Genes Re-united site, (and probably on several others).\n\nHead of the household is Arthur A, aged 50 and a Publisher from Blackheath, Kent. His 38 year old wife Anna M is from Ireland. Their other children at this time are:-\nArthur G\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..aged 6\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026born Eltham\nHarold A\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.aged 5\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.born Eltham\nEthel (?)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..aged 2\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026born Eltham\nKathleen M\u2026\u2026\u2026.aged 1\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..born Eltham\nThe Ackermans\\Ackermanns have 5 live in servants.\n\nOn the 1891 census the 13 year old Edgar C is recorded as a Boarder at a school in Compton Place Road, Eastbourne, Sussex. At the same school is a 14 year old Harold A Ackermann \u2013 the birthplace of both boys is given as Blackheath, Kent. I suspect that\u2019s Edgars brother. His father and mother are now living at 86 Walton House, Thames Street, Walton.  His mother Anna gives her birthplace as Dublin. Arthur G (16) is listed as an Art Student. Other children are Ethel, Kathleen and a younger daughter Sybil, (aged 6, born Walton, Surrey). There are three house servants.\n\nOn the 1901 census the 23 year old Edgar C, now working as a Publisher is back living with his widower father. His birthplace is recorded as Lee, Kent. The family are living at 25, Belsize Crescent, Hampstead, London. What looks like a contemporary picture can be seen in the galleries here.\n<a href=\"http://www.hampsteadheath.net/streets-a-e.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hampsteadheath.net/streets-a-e.html</a>\n Arthur, (aged 70), still shows himself as working.  Also in the household from his children are:-\nArthur G, 26, single, an Artist (Painter), born Lee, Kent\nKathleen M, 21, single, born Lee, Kent\nThere are also two live in servants. The family name is once again mis-transcribed as Ackerman.\n\nEdgar does not appear to be on the 1911 census under either spelling of his surname, but given his likely arrival in New York at the end of January of that year, perhaps this isn\u2019t so surprising. His 80 year old Father, now described as a Retired Fine Art Dealer, was recorded as the head of the household at Sussex House, Cedar Road, Sutton, Carshalton, Surrey. Living with him are his children, Gerald Ackermann, (aged 35, single and an Artist) and Sybil, (aged 25 and single \u2013 place of birth given as Waltham on Thames, Surrey). There are then three live in servants.\n\nIn the London Gazette edition of the 4th January 1921 in the List of Tradesmen who holds Warrants of Appointment to Queen Alexandra from the Lord Chamberlain to Her Majesty, with authority to use Her Majesty\u2019s Arms. These Warrants do not carry the right to fly Her Majesty\u2019s Standard, or to use the word \u201cRoyal\u201d, appears the name of Arthur Ackermann and Son Limited, Printsellers of London.\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/32180/pages/48\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/32180/pages/48</a>\nSame again in the 1922 list.\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/32565/pages/36\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/32565/pages/36</a>\nAnd so it carries on \u2013 1956 for example\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/40963/supplements/59\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/40963/supplements/59</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-10800096435-72157638155945826", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "10800096435"}}
