The Battalion was moved south with 112th Brigade, 37th Division, to take part in the Battle of Ancre in November 1916, the final act in the 5 months Battle of the Somme.  There the Bedfords fought in and around Beaumont-Hamel. During an attack three days into the battle that was held up by unbroken belts of German wire, Private John Henry Williams lost his life in fighting on Thursday 16th November 1916, a freezing cold day, assaulting up a muddy valley east of Beaumont-Hamel as the 6th Bedfords tried in vain to reach and assault German positions on the ridge called Munich Trench.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8452453407-72157632715322577", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8452453407"}}
