The 1911 census has an approximate match, born 1891, in Middlesbrough.\n\n1/6 Durham Light Infantry was raised around Bishop Auckland in August 1914 and was initially mustered at Boldon Colliery, Co Durham, between Hebburn and Sunderland.  The Battalion moved to another colliery at Ravenworth Park Drift outside Newcastle in October.  On 17th April 1915 they arrived at Boulogne as part of 151st Brigade in 50th Northumbrian Division.  151st Brigade consisted 1/6, 1/7, 1/8 and 1/9 Battalions of the Durham Light Infantry.\n\nIn April 1915 151st Brigade fought in the successful defence of Ypres at the Second Battle of Ypres as the Germans attempted to break through the Allied lines.  1/6 and 1/8 DLI suffered such heavy casualties (1/8 DLI lost 19 officers and 574 ORs) that on 3 Jun 1915 they were briefly merged to be 6/8 DLI before replacements arrived and 1/6 Battalion was reconstituted.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Somme, 151st Brigade was an assaulting formation at the Battle of Flers Courcelette, 15-22 Sep 1916, including the capture of Martinpuich.
