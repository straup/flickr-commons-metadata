Albert at age 19 is shown on the 1911 census to be employed as a painter.  He had younger siblings - Rosetta Louise, b. 1899; and George William, b. 1901.  His father was a self-employed 'wood chopper', working from home.  Their 4 room house also accommodated a lodger, John Bowen, b. 1862, a dock worker, and his infant daughter, Kate, b. 1910.\n\n109th Battery RFA was equipped with 6 x 18pdr QF guns.  In 1914 it was initially part of the Regular XXIII Bde RFA and went to France in August 1914 with 3rd Division.  On 15 Apr 1916 109th Battery was regrouped with 107th and 108th Battery to be 281 (1/2 London) Brigade RFA; but on 10 May 1916 was regrouped again into 283 (1/4 London) Brigade RFA, with 93 Battery under Lt Col Wainwright.  This organisation provided artillery support to 56(London) Division on the Somme for their attack on Gommecourt on 1 Jul 1916.  At some point after the Battle of the Somme 109th Battery was returned to 281 (1/2 London) Brigade RFA.\n\nAlbert Webber Jones, No 64728, was initially trained and employed as an Artillery Driver, working with the horses that pulled the guns and ammunition limbers.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6956197473-72157629335408084", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6956197473/#comment72157629335491808", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1333097068", "_content": "Albert Webber Jones enlisted as a Volunteer.
