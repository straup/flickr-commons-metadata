In the space titled &quot;Town of Village of Hamlet of&quot;, the census taker has helpfully written &quot;Village&quot; rather than the Village name.\n\nThe head of the family is his father &quot;Ar. Wm.&quot; Bellamy, aged 30 and a Domestic Gardener from Langford, Essex. His wife is &quot;Al.Maud&quot;, aged 30 and from Yatton.

Father Arthur William, (40), was now a Licensed Victualler as well as a Gardener, and resided with his family at The Crown, Tinwell, Lincolnshire. He and his wife Alice Maud have been married for 20 years and have had 5 children, all then still alive. Alice Maud is described as &quot;Assisting in Business&quot;\n\nChildren living with them at this time are:-\nLeonard Leslie (19) - Agricultural Machinery Fitter\nIsabel Dorothy (17) - Elementary School Teacher, Rutland County Council\nNina Maud (15) - Dressmakers assistant\nSidney Arthur (12)\nErnest Francis (9)\n\nApparently as at the start of 2013 the Pub is still there.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinwell</a>\n\nThe death of an Ernest Francis Bellamy, born 21st September 1900, was recorded in the Stamford District of Lincolnshire in the April to June quarter of 1982.", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-10799848346-72157638144572104", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "10799848346"}}
