This was the household of his parents, Robert, (aged 44 and a Stone Mason from Scotland) and Sarah A, (aged 34 and from Bradford).

His mother-in-law is the widow, Charlotte Devine, (aged 38 and a Housewife from Bradford). His wife is Mary Aickman, (aged 18, out of work and from Bradford) and their son is James Aickman, (aged 5 months and born Bradford). Robert and Mary are stated to have been married a year. Also in the household is Mary's brothers, John Devine, (aged 22 and out of work, although stated to be a Warehouseman when in work) and Frederick Devine, (aged 15 and working in a Wool Warehouse). \n\nIn such circumstances the Pre-war Army might have seemed a relatively cushy way out.", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-10799844546-72157637601876915", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "10799844546"}}
