But CCM's earlier career had followed the classic pattern for a British Empire Army officer of: Sandhurst (1879); a commission in the Queens Royal Surrey Regiment (1881); Gibraltar (1898); Guernsey (1889); India (1891) - where he served in the Malakand Field and Tirah Expeditionary Forces in the North West Frontier Province - and the Boer War (1899). Returning to the United Kingdom (1901) he was appointed first as Chief Instructor, and then Commandant, of the Army School of Musketry at Hythe in southern England. Here CCM developed the disciplines of 'Rapid aimed rifle fire' - i.e. 15 rounds per minute - and 'Fire and movement'. Of which the former skill was to prove so crucial against the German mass infantry attacks in the early days of the BEF in France and Belgium; the Germans believed they were facing machine-gun fire.\n\nIn 1911 he became a Major General commanding the 2nd London Territorial Division..\n\nIn August 1914, CCM was given command of the British Second Division of I Corps of the BEF and took it to France.", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-8613621888-72157633159842563", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8613621888/#comment72157633159847333", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1365073828", "_content": "He died in 1929, aged 69 years, whilst serving as Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's successor as a Trustee of the Imperial War Museum in London.", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-8613621888-72157633159847333", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8613621888/#comment72157633164520584", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1365074093", "_content": "His Wikipedia page is here <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Monro,_1st_Baronet\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Monro,_1st_Baronet</a>", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-8613621888-72157633164520584", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8613621888"}}
