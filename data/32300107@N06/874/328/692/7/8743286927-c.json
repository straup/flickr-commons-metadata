He was born Toronto. His next of kin is given as Mrs Hume Blake of 49 Clarendon Avenue, Toronto. He was single and serving in the militia. His medical describes him as 5 feet 11 and 3/4 inches tall, with light brown hair and brown eyes and a ruddy complexion.\n\nHis service starts from the 3rd December 1914 and he was a Lieutenant in the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles until the 1st September 1915. \n<a href=\"http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/rankDetail.asp?ID=160574\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/rankDetail.asp?I...</a>\n\nHe then transferred to the  Canadian Field Artillery.\n<a href=\"http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/rankDetail.asp?ID=160573\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/rankDetail.asp?I...</a>\n\nHe was awarded the Croix de Guerre in the post war honours,\n<a href=\"http://canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/medalDetail.asp?ID=8828\" rel=\"nofollow\">canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/medalDetail.asp?ID=8828</a>\n\nAs well as featuring in the Toronto Society Blue Book for 1913, ( &quot; a list of the top 4,000 families of Toronto and surrounding townships&quot;), he also has a pen picture in &quot;The Stone Frigate - 1914&quot; - the annual review of a military academy&quot;\n\nHollis Hume Blake - known as &quot;Jock&quot;\n\nWHO is that tall chap over there talking to that little fellow? Oh, that is Jock Blake, you've heard of him tennis, squash, cricket he's in them all and manages to give everyone a pretty warm time if he doesn't beat them, which latter is generally the case. \n\nHe is probably the neatest fellow in the Class (has never been soaked for not having shaved) and as for work, he passed in fifth and has never been in fear of the 33 mark, for which a good many of us envy him. He made a very successful job of managing the football team, as his natural temperament throws him in with men. But when it comes to ladies poor Jock has an awful time. Not being of the fussing kind, he enjoys himself about as much as a hen thrown into a pool of water, i.e., tries to get away; still he is young, and \na great illusion may find him a victim yet. \n\nAs captain of the cricket team we are looking for success under his guiding hand and if conscientious endeavor has anything to do with it the team should be as successful this year as it has been in the past. \n\nJock's course of life among us has been an exceptionally even one. His natural ability has made studies easy for him while his skill as a draughtsman has saved him the many hours of tribulation that most of us experienced. There can be no doubt that he will go through life in the easy friendly way he has gone through College. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/stonefrigate191400kinguoft/stonefrigate191400kinguoft_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/stonefrigate191400kinguoft/stonefr...</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-8743286927-72157633511611955", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8743286927/#comment72157633540836374", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1369031776", "_content": "Lieutenant Blake is wearing gorget patches (collar tabs) on his uniform lapels in this photograph, indicating that he was appointed to the General Staff.
