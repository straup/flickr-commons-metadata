Number 38 was on the east side of the street. I have determined the location using the 1915 Post Office Street Directory for London. The public house at the junction of Guilford Street and Millman Street was No.72 so counting back I have determined that No.38 is the property marked in red. The east side of the street has been completely rebuilt [not, I think, as a result of WW2 bomb damage] and nothing of the original remains.

A qualified signaller (he wears crossed flags at his lower left cuff), his cap badge is indistinct.
