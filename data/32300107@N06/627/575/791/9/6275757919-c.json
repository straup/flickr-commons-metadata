Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass howitzer shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during World War I and then converted into a gong. As well as the dining hall, there are other impressive memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in World War I, was unveiled by General Sir Alexander Godley, KCB, KCMG on 7 July 1923. It was designed by former pupil Sir Reginald Blomfield. Known as the Cross of Sacrifice this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every Commonwealth War Cemetery and other war memorials around the world.
