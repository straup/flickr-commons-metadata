The ribbon for this is 35mm wide, in stripes of equal fifths, two Carmine Red stripes on Indian Green.  The correct order of precedence would have placed the India GSM to be worn before the Delhi Durbar (Coronation) medal - Colonel Uniacke may have covered his medal ribbons to disguise this apparent tailor's error on his uniform.  The Tirah campaign included the storming of the Dargai Heights by the 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders which is where Captain Uniacke was wounded on 20th October 1897.  The Gordons won 2 Victoria Crosses there (Piper Findlater and Private Lawson).
