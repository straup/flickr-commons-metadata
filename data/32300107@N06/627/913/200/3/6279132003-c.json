A. Vernon, the principal's son. The mills were extensive, featuring two plants, equipped by Henry Simon Ltd, that had a capacity of 100 sacks per hour. W. A. Vernon described the mills in a single word as &quot;palatial&quot;. Vernon and Sons named the mill after their most successful product, a flour variety which they called &quot;Millennium Flour&quot; after winning the &quot;The Miller Challenge Cup&quot; at the 1899 International Bakers Exhibition. The flour had been selected from &quot;the best wheats of the world&quot; and was put through a carefully designed industrial process. The victory gained Vernon and Sons &quot;world-wide fame&quot; and dominance in the English flour market. Millennium Flour was aimed at the rising twentieth-century masses, proving particularly popular in the mining districts, where it was known to make &quot;beautiful white bread sandwiches.&quot; The erection of Millennium Mills at the Royal Victoria Dock meant that this new flour could be brought to the Southern England market\u201d.\nAll of these mills were partially destroyed in 1917 by the Silvertown explosion at Brunner Mond's munitions factory on the North Woolwich Road.\nVernon &amp; Sons was taken over by Spillers ltd in 1920 and Millennium Mills was rebuilt as a 10-storey concrete art deco building in 1933.\nHere is a link to a Google Earth capture overlaid with a 1901 map of the 1901 family home.\nClick on the thumb-nail for a large version.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/liits/6481446751/in/photostream]\nand a link to a photograph of the one of the panels of the Sedburgh School war memorial bearing his name\n<a href=\"http://www.cpgw.org.uk/craven_war_memorial.cfm?sID=&amp;mCode=SEDBERSC&amp;pID=4&amp;zoom=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cpgw.org.uk/craven_war_memorial.cfm?sID=&amp;mCode=SE...</a>", "authorname": "liits", "id": "32254785-6279132003-72157628344381139", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6279132003"}}
