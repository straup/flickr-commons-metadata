The irony is that Archie was born and bred - like his three brothers - in England while his father was born in Hamburg, Germany. Archie was bright (he quit Cambridge University after a term) but instead he started a new life in Haldimand County, Canada, as a miner and a miller. He joined up 'to do his bit for Canada'. He died on 21 Nov 1915, having been blown up - he had his leg amputated before he succumbed. It seems, because of his knowledge of German, he was posted right to the front of the Canadian lines, to listen in to what the Germans were saying. I am looking for any account whatsoever of his death (the war diaries don't mention him by name). I have uncovered a couple of letters in Haldimand newspapers from comrades, in which they talk of sharing out some tobacco and food that had been sent to Archie just before he died. Archie and his older brother died and their other brother (my grandfather) went on to win the MC after fighting in The Somme, Ypres and in Italy.\n\nAlso:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sachem.ca/arts_and_entertainment/article/160187\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sachem.ca/arts_and_entertainment/article/160187</a>\n\nArchibald Clement Thornton, the youngest of four sons of Rev. and Harriet Thornton, at 24 years of age left London on February 22, 1910 for Canada.\n\nHe sailed on the SS Cairnrona carrying 232 passengers. His destination was Caledonia, Ontario and he intended to farm.\n\nOnce he arrived, he was one of five boarders of Sarah (nee Webb), daughter of John Webb and Mary Ann Nichol of Walpole.\n\nSarah had married John Thompson, son of Thomas Thompson and Harriet Elly. John and Sarah had four daughters and one son born between Nov. 1894 and April 1908.\n\nJohn, a teamster, was killed on May 17, 1911 at age 44 in an accident.\n\nHaving boarders would have been a source of income for Sarah's family.\n\nSarah lived east of the Plank Road in Seneca Township, which would have been near the gypsum plant. Her five boarders were Joseph Holland, John Lemon, Archibald Thornton, Guilford Slingsby, all English and Michael McGarry, an Irishman. They were all labourers in the mines.\n\nAlthough Sarah Thompson died in Bakersfield, California, she was buried in Caledonia cemetery where her husband was buried.\n\nGuilford Slingsby and Archibald Thornton had been friends back in England. Guilford set sail for Canada July 16, 1910, five months after Archibald. Guilford, a popular name in the Slingsby family, was the son of a silk ribbon manufacturer in Nuneaton, England.\n\nAccording to more information from Robin Thornton, Archibald claimed to have earned 100 Canadian dollars in the 32 weeks that he worked in 1910.\n\nTwo days before Guilford and Archibald left Montreal with their battalion bound for England, Guilford married Ethel May Hooley at Mimico, Toronto on May 12, 1915.\n\nThey trained in a camp in the Shorncliffe area in England near the channel and on Sept. 2, 1915, the King inspected the Canadian soldiers, some 40,000.\n\nTwo weeks later, Archie was on his way to France. By November 15, he was in the Dickebusch trenches. It was here where he was wounded on Nov. 17, 1915 suffering grenade wounds to his head and leg. He was taken to a field casualty station where his leg was amputated. Archie died Nov. 19, 1915.\n\nArchie Thornton was described as a &quot;good linguist serving as a Listener on the Western Front, monitoring enemy activity and gathering intelligence, a dangerous deployment.&quot;\n\nOn January 26, 1916, the Sachem published two letters. One was written from Belgium Dec. 23, 1915 to Roy Martindale of Hamilton from &quot;Your sincere friend, A. W. Lyon&quot;. The other, also written to Roy Martindale was written from France Dec. 27, 1915 from &quot;Your old friend Gilford A. Slingsby&quot;.\n\nRoy had sent a parcel to Archie Thornton, which arrived after his death.\n\nA. W. Lyon wrote that he was returning the letter but that he had opened the parcel and gave the tobacco to Tom Pettigrew, because he was a Caledonia boy.\n\nTom is listed on Caledonia's honour roll of WWI casualties too.\n\nA. W. Lyon also wrote that he had given the &quot;tobacco to Tim Johnston, a driver for A. E. Jones bake wagon -surely you remember him. Please give my best regards to Bob A., and the rest of the boys.&quot;\n\nGuilford Slingsby's letter to Roy Martindale thanked him for a present.\n\nGuilford was lying in the hospital after an appendicitis operation and was yellow with jaundice.\n\n&quot;I hope things are pretty good with you in the dear old land of the maple. I only wish I was back there with my dear wife, but I hope to be before long. Some of the poor fellows are torn about awful. It is terrible to see them. I cannot say that I want to see the firing line again, for it is just hell and nothing else. Remember me to all kind friends, again thanking you boys for the nice present.&quot;\n\nIn 1919, Canon Thornton presented a large oil painting of the Entombment by VanDyke to his church in memory of Mrs. Thornton, claimed to have died of a broken heart over the death of her two sons two weeks before the war ended. The painting was sold in 1960. Canon Thornton and his two surviving sons, Bernard and Gerard, also placed the present carved oak choir stalls in the chancel and decorated the walls and ceilings to her memory that same year.\n\nA stained glass window in the church in memory of Frederick and Archibald was placed in the east end of the church by Canon Thornton and his two sons.\n\nRobin Thornton's original question remains unanswered. &quot;Does anyone have any letters etc. that might shed more light on Archie and what he did in his short time in Caledonia?&quot; Information about Roy Martindale is unknown, too.", "authorname": "Arnham", "id": "32254785-6279131985-72157628111606232", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279131985/#comment72157629067142669", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1327757973", "_content": "From &quot;Roll of the sons and daughters of the Anglican Church clergy throughout the world and of the naval and military chaplains of the same who gave their lives in the Great War, 1914-1918&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/rollofsonsdaught00usshrich/rollofsonsdaught00usshrich_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/rollofsonsdaught00usshrich/rollofs...</a>\nThornton, Archibald Clement, Canadian E.F., Canon Thornton, Rector of Downham, Armentieres. \nThornton, Major Frederick Edward, 105th Mahrattas, Canon Thornton, Rector of Downham\n\nRoll of Honour - Shudy Camps <a href=\"http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Cambridgeshire/ShudyCamps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.roll-of-honour.com/Cambridgeshire/ShudyCamps.html</a>\nNames of Archibald C Thornton and Frederick Edward Thornton are on a commemorative screen erected 1920 St Mary's Church, Shudy Camps.\nFrederick Edward Thornton \nMajor, 105th Mahratta Light Infantry, d 25/3/1917, commemorated: BASRA MEMORIAL, Iraq.
