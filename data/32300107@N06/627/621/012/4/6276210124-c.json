Mr. Quill was educated at the Model and Training School, in Spring Street Melbourne, and trained for mercantile pursuits. On the completion of his scholastic course he studied medicine, which nine months later he was compelled to abandon, his health being shattered by a too constant application to his books. Finding that out-door occupation was alone conducive to his good health he resided for a number of years on the Yangar Lake Station on the Murrumbidgee River. Later on he visited the Clarence River, and remained there for some four years engaged in pastoral pursuits. After that time he turned his attention to mining and eventually took up land in Monaro, near Buckly Crossing and became a grazier. Five years ago he purchased the site of his present store, adjoining which, he erected a handsome hotel", "authorname": "FAMILY HISTORIAN RESEARCHER", "id": "32254785-6276210124-72157628129735518", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6276210124/#comment72157628129742502", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69699566@N03", "iconserver": "6120", "datecreate": "1321312505", "_content": "Percy Edward Leahy extended family\n\nJerome Henry Derenzie Percival Quill was born in Ireland and arrived in Melbourne in 1857 with his family on the Horizon.

In 1878 his residence was recorded as Woolway, Monaroo (sic) where he was the overseer (according to his obituary). In 1880 he selected 640 acres on the Coonghoongbula Estate. After selling his interest in the land Henry opened a store, in Buckley's Crossing Place at the rear of Keating's Hotel. He subsequently erected the Imperial Hotel in 1883 which he conducted until his death.\nFamily tradition records that Henry was a very aristocratic man with aquiline features and later in life, a moustache. He went to church at Dalgety dressed in a frock coat and top hat. An Anglican service was held on alternating Sundays with the Catholic service, Henry, an Anglican, always went to both. \nHe was known to take an active interest in community matters. Both obituaries in local papers record that he was an all round sportsman and that he was a lover of horses.
