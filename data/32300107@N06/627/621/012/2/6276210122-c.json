[London Gazette 29589 dated 19th May 1916]. He was posted as Missing believed Killed in Action just 78 days later.\n\n2Lt Lawson would have joined the Battalion at Kemmel before it moved away for training at various locations, ready for the 'Big Push'. \n1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders was not committed to the initial attack on the Somme on 1st July, instead they moved ever closer to the front via, Houlle, Gazaincourt, Naours, Franvillers, and Bois Les Celestin.  From 8th July they underwent intensive assault training by day and night for 7 days at Bronfay Farm, now close enough to the line to be shelled.  At 03.45am on 14th July, 1st Gordons attacked and took the German second line opposite Longueval.  They were then quickly moved to Caterpillar Valley and pushed up into High Wood, despite heavy shelling, in preparation for an attack on Longueval itself which assembled at 2am and went over the top at 3.45am on 18th July.  The attack was initially successful, but untaken German strongpoints to the North of Delville Wood brought fire to bear on Longueval.  Seven hours of intensive enemy shelling heralded German counter-attacks which eventually caused the village to be evacuated.  These actions cost 1st Gordons, 4 officers killed and 7 wounded, and 321 Other Ranks killed, wounded and missing.
