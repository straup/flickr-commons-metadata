The address of the home is the Tivy Side Inn, his father being recorded as the inn-keeper. The premises survived until 1934 when it was demolished although it had not been a public house since 1930, having been closed under the auspices of the 1910 Licensing (Consolidation) Act, a re-hash of the Licensing Act 1904. Compensation was paid to the owner of the premises and the licensee for the removal of the license and the closure of the premises.\nBelow is an overlay of a 1906 map onto a Google Earth screen-shot of the location of the premises with two turn of the century photographs of the premises one showing a stage-coach the other show the premises view from across the river Tivy.
