He does not appear to have a Medal Card on the National Archive database that is unequivocally identifiable as him - from which it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that he perhaps did not deploy overseas on active service during the war.  His uniform appears pristine and shows no evidence of the rigours of campaign service.  There is something about him that suggests that he is a 'Regular' soldier.\n\nThe photograph was taken at the Hyde Park studio of Henry Walter Barnett, the society photographer who specialised in portraits, which further suggests that CoH Oakley was based in London.  The depot and remount training centre of the Royal Horse Guards 1896-1969 was at Albany Street Barracks, Regent's Park.  A substantial training and horse-keeping staff would have been required there - so perhaps, having previously been an experienced horseman, that was where he was most effective and employed.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6275823887-72157629700962217", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6275823887/#comment72157635056464248", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "93381432@N07", "iconserver": "3769", "datecreate": "1376398829", "_content": "Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me find out more about W.
