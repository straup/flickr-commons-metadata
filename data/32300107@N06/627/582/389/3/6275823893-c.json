William had in fact joined the AIF back in August 1915, but this had somehow fallen through as he was discharged two months later.  At any rate, he joined up again with his two elder brothers in August 1916 and they left Sydney together as part of the 17th Reinforcements for the 17th Infantry Battalion. \n\nBy the time they got over to Belgium to actually join their unit it was already June 1917 and preparations were well underway for the great offensive at Ypres.  The Battle of Menin Road that began on 20 September 1917 was the first engagement of Australian infantry in this offensive and proved a stunning success.\n\nBut despite this success, for the Seabrook boys it was their first, last and only battle.  All three were mortally wounded in action, and died in the days immediately afterwards.  For some the war was very short, but the sacrifice was nevertheless the full measure. \n\nOne can scarcely begin to imagine what went through the minds of William and Fanny Seabrook, and how they might come to terms with this perhaps baffling and seemingly pointless loss of their three cherished sons.\n\nWilliam is buried at the Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, just west of Ypres.  George and Theo\u2019s remains were either never identified or never found, so they  are commemorated on the Menin Gate Memorial.", "authorname": "Arnham", "id": "32254785-6275823893-72157627993296673", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6275823893/#comment72157628017845675", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1321471528", "_content": "From the Obituary to George Ross Seabrook, published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 19 December 1917:\n\n&quot;An unusually sad war tragedy has overtaken the family of Mr. and Mrs. Seabrook, of Petersham, three sons having perished on the Western front in the course of two days. The three boys\u2014the oldest was only 25\u00bd years of age\u2014were in the same battalion of infantry, and they left Sydney on the same day. The elder two of the brothers, Private George Ross Seabrook and Private Theo Leslie Seabrook, were killed in action, on September 20. The former was a master painter, well known in Petersham and Bankstown, and the latter was a fireman at the loco works at Eveleigh, and was well known in Armidale. The youngest of the three, Lieutenant W. (Keith) Seabrook, was 21 years of age, and was engaged as a telephonist at Ashfield. He died of wounds on September 21. For 12 months prior to leaving for the front he was a Lieutenant at Casula, Liverpool, and Cootamundra, and being too young to hold a commission, he went away as a sergeant, receiving his commission as Second-Lieutenant in France.&quot;//\n***\nLieutenant Keith Seabrook died of his wounds at Lijssenthoek Casualty Clearing Station.
