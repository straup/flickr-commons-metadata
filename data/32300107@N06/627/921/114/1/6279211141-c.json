Using the map and looking at Street View, the site is occupied by houses which certainly occupy the same footprint \u2013 the area much developed and the road re-named Lynton Drive, the house being number 30. I am uncertain if they are of the period \u2013 even if they have heavily rebuilt, they look a bit up-market for a general labourer with five children.\nClick on the picture below for a larger view but it may take a few minutes as it\u2019s a large photo.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/liits/6350098293/in/photostream]", "authorname": "liits", "id": "32254785-6279211141-72157628141647492", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279211141/#comment72157628142410268", "realname": "Steve Smith", "path_alias": null, "author": "69798423@N03", "iconserver": "8322", "datecreate": "1321466853", "_content": "Walter landed in France on 4th December 1915 in conjunction with the landing of the 10th and 11th SWB landing at Le Harve with the 38th (Welsh) Division.\n\nSDGW Info:\n\nName: Walter Williams\nBirth Place: Birkdale, Lancs\nDeath Date: 10 Jul 1916\nDeath Location: France &amp; Flanders \nEnlistment Location: Liverpool\nRank: L/Corporal\nRegiment: South Wales Borderers\nBattalion: 11th Battalion\nNumber: 22554\nType of Casualty: Killed in action\nTheatre of War: Western European Theatre", "authorname": "Steve Smith 1944", "id": "32254785-6279211141-72157628142410268", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6279211141"}}
