It formed with 41st Brigade of 14th (Light) Division, undergoing training at Aldershot and Grayshott.  8 RB landed at Boulogne in May 1915.  The battalion went into trenches in the Ypres salient and fought at Hooge, 30-31 July 1915, where the Germans used flamethrowers for the first time.  A 19 year old 2Lt of 8 RB, Sidney Clayton Woodroffe won a Victoria Cross in this battle.  In November another 8 RB soldier, 21 year old Corporal Alfred George Drake won a posthumous Victoria Cross for his gallantry in rescuing his wounded officer, Lt Henry Tryon, on 23rd November 1915 near La Brique in Belgium.  (Lt Tryon was subsequently killed in action at Flers on 15th September 1916).\n8 RB were committed to the battle for Flers and Courcelette, 15-22 September 1916, the third main phase of the Battle of the Somme, which saw the first significant use of tanks by the British.  Preceded by a ferocious artillery bombardment of even greater intensity than that for 1st July, this major attack, employing 49 Mk1 tanks, sought to achieve a decisive breakthrough by 4th Army.\nThe assault on Flers began at 5.30am with an attack by two companies of 6 KOYLI  supported by one tank to destroy a forward strongpoint of German infantry to the East of Delville Wood.  \nThat achieved 14th Light Division (41st Brigade [7 and 8 KOYLI and 7 and 8 RB] 42nd Brigade and 43rd Brigade) the central of the three leading divisions of the XV Corps attack, supported by most of the tanks, then advanced taking just 3 hours to seize their first, second and third objectives of four.  The third, the devastated village of Flers, was captured by 9am on the morning of 15th September and 41st Brigade went firm there.  On 16th September the attack was resumed at 9.25am, but  the artillery bombardment was less effective and despite great cost 14th Division could make no further headway in the face of stubborn German resistance.  21st Division attempted to push around the ruined village but it too was stopped.  The remaining efforts of the Flers-Courcelette attack consolidated the newly gained front line around High Wood.  Casualties, German reinforcement, counter-attacks and heavy rains from 18th September onwards, made regaining the initial momentum impossible and the attack was formally ended on 22nd September.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6279211125-72157628330400497", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279211125/#comment72157628331381049", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1323345862", "_content": "Serjeant E L Vickers was commissioned as a Temporary Second Lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade with effect 16th January 1916.
