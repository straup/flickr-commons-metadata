Oswald was the Son of the late Edwin and Mary Williams, of School House, Risca, Monmouth. Oswald was educated at Llandovery from 1908 until 1912, where he was Senior Prefect and Captain of the School. On leaving Llandovery, Oswald entered St John's College, Oxford, where he graduated with First Class Honours Moderations in Mathematics. He enlisted into the Army in 1914, and was commissioned into 16th (Cardiff City) Battalion, Welsh Regiment in early 1915. The Battalion was attached to 114 Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division, and moved to France during December 1915, taking up positions near Armentieres. In the April of 1916, Oswald was serving with 'B' Company of his Battalion at Givenchy, when on 9 April 1916 a raid was made on a German machine-gun emplacement. As they attempted to place a 'Bangalore Torpedo' in the enemy wire, a bomb was thrown from the German trenches killing Oswald. He was just 21 years old, and his body was never found. Oswald is commemorated on the Loos Memorial, France.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.laugharnewarmemorial.co.uk/page38.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.laugharnewarmemorial.co.uk/page38.htm</a>", "authorname": "Arnham", "id": "32254785-6279211139-72157627984203501", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279211139/#comment72157629001969293", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1327350777", "_content": "FreeBMD\nWilliams  Oswald Morgan birth reg 4th qr 1893 Newport, M. 11a  225\nDeath date 09/04/1916 quoted above makes him age 22 not age 21 at time of death.", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-6279211139-72157629001969293", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6279211139"}}
