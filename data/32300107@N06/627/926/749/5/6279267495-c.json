In the following year Mr Carslake by his individual exertions extinguished an alarming fire, which had broken out in the cockpit of the Victory.  He next accompanied Lord Nelson to the West Indies in pursuit of the combined fleets; and for his subsequently meritorious conduct at the battle of Trafalgar 21st October 1805 was promoted the very next day to a lieutenancy in the Bellisle 74 with Captain William Hargood.  On 17th December 1805 he rejoined the St George with Captain Thomas Bertie attached to the fleet in the Channel, where we find him intrepidly dashing overboard at a time when the sea was boisterous in the extreme and saving the life of a seaman of the First Lieutenant Mr Carfield. In consequence of this act of heroism he was appointed on 12th September 1807 as First on board the Proserpine 32 with Captain Charles Otter with whom after bringing home from Gottenborg Lord Leverson Gower, the British Ambassador to the court of St Petersburg Russia. He then preceeded to watch the port of Toulon whilst employed on board the Proserpine was attacked on 28th February 1809 and in spite of a noble resistance in which she sustained a loss of 1 man killed and 10 wounded was captured by the French 40-gun frigates Penelope and Pauline; owing to which untoward circumstance Lieutenant Carslake was detained a prisoner in France until May 1814. On 4th April 1815 he became First on board the Tartarus 20 bearing the flag in the Scheldt of Sir Pulteney Malcolm, in which ship he remained until paid off in November 1816.  Since that period he had neither been afloat nor was he able to procure the promotion, which was believed freely granted at the conclusion of the war to every other First-Lieutenant of a ship that had been captured.\nLieutenant Carslake was a Magistrate for the County pf Devon who married Thomazine Leigh on 30th September 1817 youngest daughter of the Late William Leigh Esq, of Slade House Sidmouth. \n\n\nLeiutenant John Carslake of HM Royal Navy born 12th September 1785 Colyton Devon died 19th August 1865 at Arlington House Clifton Bristol husband of Thomazine Pearse Carslake born 28th October 1796 died 30th January 1883 at 58 Porchester Terrace London", "authorname": "FAMILY HISTORIAN RESEARCHER", "id": "32254785-6279267495-72157628001648309", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279267495/#comment72157628001690965", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69699566@N03", "iconserver": "6120", "datecreate": "1321286310", "_content": "This was posted on the SWMaritime History Website\nBoringdon Hall - Commemorative Nelson Bicentenary Lunch - Sunday 20th November 2005.\nOn a damp grey Sunday some 50 members attended an excellent luncheon at the delightful Boringdon Hall where after a pre-lunch drink we partook of prime roast beef followed by cannon and grapeshot (profiteroles) and we then entertained by a fascinating talk from Peter Yule-Booth, two of whose ancestors had fought at Trafalgar. John Yule was Fourth Lieutenant and his brother-in-law, John Carslake was a midshipman. Our speaker was the great great great grandson of John Yule who appears in the famous painting of the death of Nelson by Devis. Devis had come aboard &quot;Victory&quot; when she returned to Portsmouth and sketched everyone that was present. He took us though his naval career from his being examined for Lieutenant in 1796 at the age of 17 and his subsequent service on the &quot;Bellerephon&quot; - colloquially known in the Navy as &quot;Billy Ruff'n&quot;. Interestingly as an aside this was the vessel which later took the surrender of Napoleon. John Yule later saw action at the battle of the Nile and aboard HMS Victory at Trafalgar.\n\nJohn Carslake was born in Colyton on 12 September 1785, the son of Bamfield Carslake the local surgeon. He joined the navy on 18 January 1799 as a first class volunteer aboard the Royal George, bearing the flag of Lord Bridport and by 1800 was a midshipman. He spent a period in the West Indies on board Courageux under Captain John Okes Hardy, but when hostilities resumed he joined his brother-in-law, John Yule, on the Victory There he was involved in extinguishing a serious fire in the ship's cockpit. As Lieutenant Pasco, who was first Lieutenant and later responsible for Nelson's famous signal to the fleet just before Trafalgar, said, 'the fire caused such panic on board the Victory that many jumped overboard and were not restored to a sense of their duty but by the drummer beating the quarters and by you. It was your coolness and self command that got the fire under, by causing wet hammocks to smother the blaze and it was generally thought at the time that had you been qualified Lord Nelson would have promoted you on the instant.'\n\nCarslake's meritorious conduct at Trafalgar resulted in his being mentioned to Lord Collingwood, who promoted him the day after the battle to lieutenant.\n\nThis just a small flavour of the talk which kept our speaker on his feet answering questions from his very detailed research.
