He then served an apprenticeship to shoemaking with Mr Oag, Dounby, to whom he was afterwards vanman. Subsequently he managed the branch of Mr Irving\u2019s boot store in Finstown. He went to Sydney, Australia , eight years ago, and was in the employ of the Government when war broke out. He volunteered for active service in September 1914, and came to Gallipoli in the A.S.C, in which corps he attained the rank of sergeant. He resigned this rank, however, for the purpose of getting into the A.F.A. as a gunner. After eight months\u2019 service in Gallipoli he was drafted to France, where he was wounded; and was treated in an English hospital. He was home for a few days in October 1916. After rejoining his battery he was in France until he was suddenly killed at Ypres on 21st July last. A comrade writes:- \u201cHe was a great favourite, and everybody\u2019s friend, and was held in high esteem by officers and men\u201d. Victor was a staunch Good Templar, and was for some time C.T. of the Birsay lodge. J.Victor Bias was the second son of Mr and Mrs  Thomas Bias, Flaws, Birsay. Their eldest son, Lieut. J. W. Bias is in the Royal Naval Reserve\u201d.", "authorname": "AndyBailey", "id": "32254785-6279267493-72157628119912100", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279267493/#comment72157634830375835", "realname": "lee finch", "path_alias": "leefinch", "author": "42903797@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1375047910", "_content": "another fellow gunner committed to the big fella in the sky.x", "authorname": "commando29", "id": "32254785-6279267493-72157634830375835", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6279267493"}}
