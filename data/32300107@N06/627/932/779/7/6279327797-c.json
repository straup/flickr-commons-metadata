Only one named Richard Johnston was killed in WWI and he died in 1915.\n\nLooking at the Buffs Roll of Honour it looks as though Robert survived the war and was perhaps reported as being missing because he was a POW.\n\nSee this link:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.hut-six.co.uk/GreatWar/EastKentRegiment_J.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hut-six.co.uk/GreatWar/EastKentRegiment_J.html</a>\n\nBoth the 6th and 7th Buffs were involved in the 3rd battle of the Scarpe in May 1917. The 6th saw action at Monchy and the 7th at Cherisy, both going over the top on 3rd May 1917. Both suffered heavy casualties the 6th losing 25 other ranks killed, 128 wounded and 207 missing and the 7th losing 25 other ranks killed, 169 wounded and 174 missing.\n\nMost of the men reported missing were later accounted for or listed as being POWs.", "authorname": "Steve Smith 1944", "id": "32254785-6279327797-72157628134902966", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6279327797"}}
