They were checking the ground to plan the gradual thinning out of the troops holding the Battalion line prior to the evacuation from Anzac just over a week later.  That difficult operation was carried out without discovery by the Turks, but James Harcus did not live to slip away with his company.  He and Major Richard Jenkins were killed outright by the exploding shell, while Major Gordon Uther was fatally wounded and died later that day.\n\n James Harcus was 34 years old when he was killed on Russell\u2019s Top on 11th December 1915.  The three brother officers were buried next day in the cemetery at the foot of Walker\u2019s Ridge, but the graves of Majors James Harcus and Richard Jenkins could not be located when the Imperial War Graves Commission consolidated the Anzac cemeteries after the war ended.  Their names are therefore commemorated together on Panel 64 of the Lone Pine Memorial.\n\nThe Lone Pine Memorial commemorates more than 4,900 Australian and New Zealand servicemen who died in the Anzac area or of wounds received there and whose graves are not known.", "authorname": "Arnham", "id": "32254785-6279327795-72157627987523353", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279327795/#comment72157631767975896", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1350232238", "_content": "He was the son of Andrew Harcus and Jane Maria Logie, born on 22nd Nov 1881 according to an online family tree <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ancestry.co.uk</a>\n\nIn 1891 they lived at Heather Bank, Westray, Orkney. <a href=\"http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/2837/details/westray+heatherbank/\" rel=\"nofollow\">canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/2837/details/westray+heathe...</a> Heatherbank, &quot;an old cottage uninhabited&quot; <a href=\"http://www.geolocation.ws/v/W/File:Heatherbank, Westside, Westray - geograph.org.uk - 493501.jpg/-/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.geolocation.ws/v/W/File:Heatherbank,%20Westside,%20We...</a>\n\nBy 1901 James was a Law Clerk (apprentice) boarding with relatives at 12, Bridge Street Wynd, Kirkwall, Orkney <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=511&amp;wrapid=tlif135023253712110&amp;q=12+bridge+street,+wynd,+kirkwall,+orkney&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x489b01613aa306ad:0xc83bc5dc32fcd09f,12+Bridge+Street+Wynd,+Kirkwall+KW15+1JD,+UK&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Met6UM-lMOPX0QW13IDABw&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf...</a>.
