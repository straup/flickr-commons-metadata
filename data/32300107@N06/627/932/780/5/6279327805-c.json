He was subsequently posted as Missing In Action. On 24th December, Pte Donald Hector Macrostie, 2939, from Alfred\u2019s battalion made a statement whilst he was recovering  in 3rd London General Hospital, Wandsworth, to the effect that Alfred was killed whilst being carried, wounded, on his back during an attack on Monquet Farm on 4th September 1916. Pte Mc Crostie was wounded at the same time, and therefore had no knowledge of Alfred\u2019s burial. \n\nIt transpired that Alfred had been buried just north of Pozieres. On 24/04/1917 a Court of Inquiry declared that Alfred had been Killed in Action. \n\nAfter the war Alfred\u2019s body was exhumed and re-interred in Courcelette British Cemetery.", "authorname": "AndyBailey", "id": "32254785-6279327805-72157628042565239", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279327805/#comment72157628613933943", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1325127581", "_content": "Source of some of the above info <a href=\"http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=156737\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=156737</a>  \nThe Monquet Farm is actually Mouquet Farm.  \nSee <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mouquet_Farm\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mouquet_Farm</a>\nQuote &quot;The Battle of Mouquet Farm, which began on 5 August 1916, was part of the Battle of the Somme and followed the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res.
