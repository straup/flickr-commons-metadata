The Memorial stands on the high ground ('Hill 104') behind the Villers-Bretonneux Military Cemetery, Fouilloy, which is about 2 km north of Villers-Bretonneux on the east side of the road to Fouilloy.\n\nThe Australian National Memorial, Villers-Bretonneux is approached through the Military Cemetery, at the end of which is an open grass lawn which leads into a three-sided court. The two pavilions on the left and right are linked by the north and south walls to the back (east) wall, from which rises the focal point of the Memorial, a 105 foot tall tower, of fine ashlar. A staircase leads to an observation platform, 64 feet above the ground, from which further staircases lead to an observation room. This room contains a circular stone tablet with bronze pointers indicating the Somme villages whose names have become synonymous with battles of the Great War; other battle fields in France and Belgium in which Australians fought; and far beyond, Gallipoli and Canberra.\n\nOn the three walls, which are faced with Portland stone, are the names of 10,885 Australians who were killed in France and who have no known grave. The 'blocking course' above them bears the names of the Australian Battle Honours.\n\nAfter the war an appeal in Australia raised \u00a322,700, of which \u00a312,500 came from Victorian school children, with the request that the majority of the funds be used to build a new school in Villers-Bretonneux. The boys' school opened in May 1927, and contains an inscription stating that the school was the gift of Victorian schoolchildren, twelve hundred of whose fathers are buried in the Villers-Bretonneux cemetery, with the names of many more recorded on the Memorial. Villers-Bretonneux is now twinned with Robinvale, Victoria, which has in its main square a memorial to the links between the two towns.", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-6279327801-72157628615362739", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6279327801/#comment72157628685324739", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1325532793", "_content": "Mistakes are sometimes made as I believe is the case with the first name here.  Further investigation reveals that this photograph was originally catalogued at the IWM in their Bond of Sacrifice Classified Collection as HU96646:  ascribed, as shown, to be Private Jolly, Robert; Duke of Wellington's Regiment.  There can be little doubt that he is wearing the cap badge of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (The West Riding) of a 'lion rampant carrying a banner unfurled within a crown' as opposed to the 'rising sun' of the AIF.  It is possible of course, that for some reason Henry Harry Jolly was actually known as 'Robert' or 'Bob' - a nickname perhaps, or allusion to a sportsman or well known (then) Yorkshireman.
