He was killed at Lajj, Mesopotamia, on 5 March 1917. \n\nPhotograph presented by Hon. Mr Justice Eve. According to the 13th Hussars' War Diary, on 5 March 1917, the Brigade at Lajj were stationed at their bivouac when armoured cars arrived to report that Turkish forces had fled Lajj and were moving east. Colonel Richardson, Commanding Officer of the 13th Hussars, intended to attempt to charge a convoy that had been reported. \n\nDespite coming under fire from Turkish Infantry forces from a shallow nullah (gully), the charge was deemed a success. After clearing the nullah, however, the Brigade came under further heavy fire from trenches some 200 yards away. In combination with the dust caused by machine gun fire and wind, the enemy fire proved effective. \n\nOf 14 Officers and around 200 men that charged, 9 Officers and 85 men were killed. Upon inspection the next day, it was discovered that Turkish forces had a strongly entrenched position from the Tigris to Lajj.\n\n<b>Faces of the First World War</b>\nThe full story is not always known to us.
