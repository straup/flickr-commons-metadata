Sir Alfred Sharpe had been the first governor of Nyasaland. Maurice was educated at Haileybury (Batten House, 1901-05) and Rugby before receiving a business training at Messrs. Storey Bros., Lancashire.\n\n21 Sqn RFC re-equipped with B.E.12 aircraft in August 1916, relinquishing its previous R.E.7 aircraft. The B.E.12 was a single seat derivative of the two seat B.E.2c, and inherited the B.E.2c\u2019s inherent stability. This made the aircraft almost immediately obsolete as a fighter, although it was also utilised as a bomber. During this period 21 Sqn were based at Bertangles Aerodrome.\n\nOn the 28th October 1916, in the midst of the Battle of the Somme,  2nd Lt Maurice Sharpe took off at 0745hrs for a patrol over the enemy front lines in  B.E.12 serial number C6483. At 0930 he entered combat with enemy aircarft over the village of Courcelette. Maurice's aircraft was last seen in a steep dive.Initially posted as missing, Maurice's death in action was confirmed in 1917.  He was 29 years old. It is likely that he was shot down by Leutenant Hans von Keudell of Jasta 1, his fourth victory. (Von Keudell was killed in action with 12 victories on 15/02/1917).\n\n \u201cSecond Lieutenant MAURICE SHARPE, R.F.C., after having been reported missing, is now officially reported killed in action. He was the youngest son of Sir Alfred Sharpe, C.B., K.C.M.G., and of Lady Sharpe, of Elmhurst, Lancaster. Educated at Rugby, he had a business training with Messrs. Storey Bros., Lancaster. He took part in the campaign in the Cameroon, and afterwards obtained a commission in the Royal Flying Corps. He was 29 years of age. He was a keen Rugby forward, and excelled in rowing, hockey, and motoring. He is the seventh Rugby forward of the Vale of Lune Club who has been killed in action. Ten of the playing members of the club have fallen in the war.\u201d (Flight Magazine 16th August 1917)\n\nMaurice has no known grave but is commemorated on the Lancaster War Memorial, the Haileybury School War Memorial, And the Arras Flying Services Memorial.", "authorname": "AndyBailey", "id": "32254785-6275892649-72157627978445261", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6275892649/#comment72157628109056060", "realname": "IWM Collections", "path_alias": "imperialwarmuseum", "author": "32300107@N06", "iconserver": "5535", "datecreate": "1321086241", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/andybailey] Thank you for your work on this photo a, we really appreciate it.

Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass howitzer shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during World War I and then converted into a gong. As well as the dining hall, there are other impressive memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in World War I, was unveiled by General Sir Alexander Godley, KCB, KCMG on 7 July 1923. It was designed by former pupil Sir Reginald Blomfield. Known as the Cross of Sacrifice this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every Commonwealth War Cemetery and other war memorials around the world. (Wikipedia: Cross of Sacrifice - The Cross of Sacrifice was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield for the Imperial War Graves Commission and is usually present in Commonwealth war cemeteries containing 40 or more graves.)\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the Victoria Cross, and three the George Cross.", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-6275892649-72157628992596231", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6275892649/#comment72157628992835107", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1327298241", "_content": "Alfred Sharpe had eldest child, Edmund, born in Fiji 'in his early years' and moved with him to Nyasaland.
