This was a Territorial infantry battalion.  It mobilised on 4th August 1914, at 56 Davies Street, Berkeley Square, London on the outbreak of war and additional enlistments were welcomed at the Davies Street recruiting office from 6th August.  After training at Pirbright and Crowborough, 9th Londons disembarked at Le Havre in France on 5th November 1914.  The Battalion was initially assigned to 13th Brigade in 5th Division until 10th February 1916 when it was sent to 169th Brigade in 56th (London) Division.\nQueen Victoria\u2019s Rifles were notably engaged in the battle for Hill 60 near Ypres, 20th\u201321st April 1916, during which a QVR platoon commander, 2Lt G H Wolley QVR, won a Victoria Cross.  12 officers and 180 other ranks of the QVR were killed and wounded in this action. \nAfter trench duties on the Somme, QVR moved up to Arras with 56th Division at the beginning of April 1917 and were committed to the First Battle of the Scarpe, 9th-14th April 1917, as part of the wider Arras offensive which included the Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge.  The division captured the fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse and pressed on to gain the Wancourt Line, with a German trench complex known as the Monchyriegel, anchored on Monchy-le-Preux, as their objective.  However several battalions in 56th Division are recorded as suffering over 300 casualties and it was probably during this fighting that Sergeant Servante was wounded.\nThe IWM has microfilmed the diaries of Cpl J P Fitch MM of 9th Londons (Jan-Oct 1916) and of Lt W H T Clements of 2nd Londons who was in 169th Brigade Feb 1916-Jan 1918.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6275892639-72157628306161345", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6275892639"}}
