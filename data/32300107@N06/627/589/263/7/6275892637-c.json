In 1881 he was working as a civil engineer.\n\nHe married Fanny Mary Warburton in Poplar in 1881 and died in Kensington in 1922, aged 66.  I haven't been able to find any reference to his service during the war but perhaps that's to be expected as his regiment stayed in the UK.  It was a service battallion and remained in England as a reserve battallion.
