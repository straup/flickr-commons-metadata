[London Gazette 28755 of 12 Sep 1913].   It was not until the outbreak of war in August 1914 that he was attached to the 2nd Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers, and sailed with the Battalion to France on 11th August 1914.\n\nEdward Collingwood-Thompson appears to have been mortally wounded by indirect machine-gun fire from German positions on the far side of the river.  There is a private memorial in the town of La Ferte to this much loved and missed young officer, erected by his family.\n\nEdward Collingwood-Thompson was born in Taunton, Somerset, on 8 Dec 1893, the only son of Mr and Mrs Edward Collingwood-Thompson.  He was educated at Cheltenham and The Oratory School, Edgbaston, (a Catholic school now at Woodcote, Reading).  Despite winning a prize cadet scholarship for the Royal Military College Sandhurst, he opted to go to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, possibly intending to study for a Commission in the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers.\n\nThere is a 2Lt Leslie Collingwood Thompson, possibly a younger nephew, shown Commissioned into the 2nd/6th County of London Volunteer Regiment on 11th September 1917.
