Lt Naish was a platoon commander in B Company.  This arduous work was predominantly conducted at night in the most unpleasant and hazardous conditions even by the standards of the Western Front.  The original 1,000 strong battalion, chiefly composed of East End Londoners, with contingents from Somerset and Co Durham (miners), retained a distinctly 'Cockney' sense of humour.  The Adjutant and RSM were both ex-Grenadier Guardsmen.  Formed on 20 Aug 1915, 20 KRRC sailed for France on 27 March 1916.\n\nFrom &quot;A Short History of 20th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps - 1915-19&quot; by Captain A S Turberville MC.  12 July 1916 - near Montauban on the Somme.\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/20thbattbelpione00turbuoft/20thbattbelpione00turbuoft_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/20thbattbelpione00turbuoft/20thbat...</a> \n\n\n&quot;Opposite rose a higher ridge, the present German position, on which were Mametz and Delville Woods and the villages of Contal-Maison, Bazentin-le-Grand and Longueval. The intervening valley had not as yet been completely secured. A copse there, called Caterpillar Wood, was disputed territory. Running at right angles from 'Montauban Alley', into this wood ran East Trench. In the nature of the case this was no health resort. Major Martin's men (A, B and part of C Coys) had to drain the trench and render it passable for the infantry moving up to Caterpillar Wood. In addition to this they had to bridge the large number of captured trenches running between Carnoy and Montauban, and to make an efficient roadway between those villages for the large traffic which the military situation required. The last was a formidable undertaking, as the existing track, which ran through cuttings, was much too narrow and needed metalling throughout. These tasks involved a number of fatal casualties from shell fire and from snipers. \nWhen the remainder of the battalion arrived they reinforced their predecessors in their work, and were also employed in the somewhat venturesome task of making forward dumps of R.E. materials in No Man's Land at various points in front of the front line in the valley between the Montauban and Mametz ridges, now thinly occupied at night by British patrols. This was in preparation for the second great attack which was timed for July 14th. \nUnhappily here that the Battalion sustained its first loss in officers in a reconnoitring expedition on July 12th in preparation for the approaching battle. Captain Hole was badly hit, Lieut. Naish killed outright, and Sec.-Lieut. Perry mortally wounded. This was a heavy loss, as Capt. Hole was one of the most experienced soldiers in the battalion, and the subalterns two of its most expert professional engineers. All three in very different ways had been most popular.&quot;//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6282834456-72157628113742191", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6282834456"}}
