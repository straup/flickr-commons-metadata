He was gassed in March 1918 and wounded again in August 1918. He was promoted to Captain after the first Somme battle in 1916 and to Major after the battle at Messines.

I would say this fellow is an offshoot of them.\n\nAlso a great site for historic births, deaths and marriages is:\n<a href=\"https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/Home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/Home/</a>\nFrom here you can work out spouses, parents and siblings if not sure of relationships in military information and then order certificates.  For example if you go to marriage search and type in William NARBEY it shows his wife as Eva Mildred WEBBY and their registration number as 1913/8625.  You can then trace their children if any.\n\nAnother search in Archways shows that William and Eva's divorce was filed c1919:\n<a href=\"http://archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?code=16698000\" rel=\"nofollow\">archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?code=16698000</a>\n\nHe married secondly on 27 Mar 1920 in Chapel Royal, Savoy, London, England to Florence GOODMAN, she was born in 1880.
