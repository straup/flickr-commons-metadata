Two of these Nanton family heirlooms, a knife and a sword with a scabbard, recently underwent treatment in the Art Conservation programme at Queen's University. The style and construction of the knife identify it as an Afghan or Khyber knife, decorated on both sides and top of the blade with an Indian metal inlay technique known as koftgari. The second weapon can be classified as a talwar with a Persian blade made of watered steel and an Indian hilt also decorated with koftgari inlay. The history of both types of arms is closely linked to the establishment and spread of the Mughal Empire in India during the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries.", "authorname": "Historydevotee", "id": "32254785-6282834460-72157628111319308", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6282834460/#comment72157627988049049", "realname": "Caroline & Jarrett", "path_alias": "lindholmorrison", "author": "66048793@N00", "iconserver": "67", "datecreate": "1321134160", "_content": "There is an avenue called Nanton in Vancouver, British Columbia.
