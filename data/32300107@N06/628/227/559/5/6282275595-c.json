In 1901 Henry and his son Stewart shared their home with Henry\u2019s sister Jessie, and three servants and in 1909 Henry married once more,  Louisa Mary Beauchamp becoming the 13 year old Stewart\u2019s step-mother.\n\nMentioned in Dispatches London Gazette 01/01/1916 (page 24), 04/07/1917 (page 197), and 11/12/1917 (page 12915)", "authorname": "AndyBailey", "id": "32254785-6282275595-72157628119633490", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6282275595"}}
