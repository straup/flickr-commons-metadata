He is commemorated at the Baghdad (North Gate) War Cemetery, Iraq. \n\nLieutenant-General Sir Stanley Maude's despatch described the action at Lajj as follows:\n\n&quot;On the 5th, the supply situation having been rapidly re-adjusted, Lieut.-General Marshall marched to Zeur (18 miles), preceded by the cavalry, which moved seven miles further to Lajj. \n\nHere the Turkish rearguard was found in an entrenched position, very difficult to locate by reason of a dense dust storm that was blowing and of a network of nalas, with which the country is intersected. \n\nThe cavalry was hotly engaged with the enemy in this locality throughout the day, and took some prisoners. A noticeable feature of the day's work was a brilliant charge made, mounted, by the Hussars straight into the Turkish trenches.&quot; \n\nPhotograph presented by Hon. Mr Justice Eve.\n\nAccording to the 13th Hussars' War Diary for 5 March 1917, the brigade at Lajj were stationed at their bivouac when armoured cars arrived to report that Turkish forces had fled Lajj and were moving east. \n\nColonel Richardson, commanding officer of the 13th Hussars, intended to attempt to charge a convoy that had been reported. Despite coming under fire from Turkish Infantry forces from a shallow nullah (gully), the charge was deemed a success. \n\nAfter clearing the nullah, however, the brigade came under further heavy fire from trenches some 200 yards away. In combination with the dust caused by machine gun fire and wind, the enemy fire proved effective. \n\nOf 14 officers and around 200 men that charged, nine officers and 85 men were killed. Upon inspection the next day, it was discovered that Turkish forces had a strongly entrenched position from the Tigris to Lajj.\n\n<b>Faces of the First World War</b>\nThe full story is not always known to us.
