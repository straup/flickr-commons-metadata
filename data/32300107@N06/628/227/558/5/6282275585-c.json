'Alf' Musto (b. 1883) was the son of Alfred George Musto, a Beer House Keeper, of 74 White Horse Lane, Mile End Old Town.  'Alf' originally worked as a barman for his father, before realising the opportunity that commercial photography offered him.  In addition to portraits, from 1898 he took some remarkable photographs on visits to Essex, recording rural and seaside scenes at Mistley, Manningtree and Lawford, and including events such as the celebrations for the coronation of George V in 1907; and the surrender of the German submarine fleet at Harwich in November 1918.  'Alf' Musto was married to Alice (b. 1883) and they had a son, Alfred Andrew, (b.1908).//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6282275585-72157629130924385", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6282275585"}}
