This is the household of his parents, Thomas C, (aged 30 and a Railway Clerk from Bethnal Green) and Esther, (aged 30 and from Mile End London). They also have a daughter, Ivy, aged 5 months. Each house on the street is divided into two households - looking at the current for sales it looks like many of these bay fronted Victorian Terrace houses on this road are still split into two flats.\n\nThe same individual appears to be recorded on the 1911 census as a Thomas Harold and his father as Thomas Charles. The family still reside in the Mile End District - afraid I don't have a full subscription so can't check the details. His sister is Ivy Esther.\n\nThe marriage of a Thomas H. Willy to an Ivy E.Craddock took place in the District of West Ham, London in the April to June 1912 quarter.\n\nIt may be a co-incidence, but the birth of an Ivy L Willy to a mother whose maiden name was Craddock, was recorded in the Poplar District of London in the July to September 1912 quarter.\n\n1/17th (County of London) Battalion (Poplar and Stepney Rifles)\nAugust 1914 : at 66 Tredegar Road, Bow.

Day 93\n\nEaucourt L\u2019Abbaye\n\nLocated south east of Le Sars 141 Bde of 47th Div attacked here supported by two tanks.\n\n1/19th London Regt was held up by MG fire, sheltering in shell holes 50 yards from the German Line. The tanks worked along Flers Trench allowing the Londons to advance and link with the New Zealanders on the Le Barque Road. 1/20th London Regt waited for the tanks too and then swept through Eaucourt L\u2019Abbaye and linked with 1/19th Bn. During this attack the tanks were ditched in Flers Trench and so 1/17th London did not have their support on the left flank. Held up by uncut wire and MG fire,a German counter attack drove them back.\n<a href=\"http://forum.irishmilitaryonline.com/showthread.php?9058-The-Somme-Day-by-Day/page5\" rel=\"nofollow\">forum.irishmilitaryonline.com/showthread.php?9058-The-Som...</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-8032345119-72157631670089748", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8032345119/#comment72157631774121479", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1350295886", "_content": "Thomas Harold Willy born Dec Q 1893 Bethnal Green according to Birth Index &amp; 1901 census.

His medal index card gives his original TF number: 3562 and his later six-digit TF number which would have been issued in early 1917.  His four digit number tells us that he joined the 17th Londons between 20th and 27th Feb 1915 and he was issued with a six-digit number because at the time of issue he had not been officially reported as KiA.  In essence, in 1917 when the TF was re-numbered, he was still on the 17th London's books as missing, hence the reason why he was issued a second number.  The comment written on his MIC that he was &quot;DEAD 1-10-16&quot; post-dates the issue of this second six-digit number.", "authorname": "Paul C A Nixon", "id": "32254785-8032345119-72157632012953329", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8032345119"}}
