So then I wondered if perhaps the photograph was taken while he was in training and that he was promoted prior to actual entering a Theatre of War - and that higher rank would be on the MIC.\n\nSo I tried searching for him as Captain Abbott of the Artillery and came up with a potential match - a Joseph Palmer Abbott, a Captain of the Royal Field Artillery. Most intriguing was the fact that his previous rank had been Private 1792 in the Australian Infantry Force. The Medal Index Card reference is WO 372/1/2434 \n<a href=\"http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=D987339\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=D9...</a>\n\nOf course if that was all I had I would have left it there - there is no matching candidate on the Commonwealth War Graves Commissions site for example. However there are a lot of good sources out there about individuals who served in the AIF - and a search for more information about Joseph Palmer Abbott produced an article in the Australian National Biography series about him - both his wartime service and subsequent role in the Australian Wool Industry and Australian Politics. The crux is that the article is illustrated with a picture (taken circa 1940) of an older man but there are definately a number of shared characteristics. My supposition is that its the same individual.\n\nI won't post more here from his biography in case I'm wrong, but heres a link so you can check out the picture. \n<a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/abbott-joseph-palmer-joe-9303\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/abbott-joseph-palmer-joe-9303</a>\n\nHis Australian Army Records can be seen here\n<a href=\"http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=3016756\" rel=\"nofollow\">recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/ItemDetail.a...</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-8878633349-72157633816906342", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8878633349/#comment72157633863032175", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1370124620", "_content": "Supplement 11286 to the London Gazette dated 24th September 1918 publishes the Citation for the award of the Military Cross to Joseph Palmer Abbott, but shows him to be  serving with the South African Force:\n\nLieutenant Joseph Palmer Abbott RFA; Special Reserve.\n\n&quot;For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when enemy shelling set fire to charges and exploded shells in two gun pits.
