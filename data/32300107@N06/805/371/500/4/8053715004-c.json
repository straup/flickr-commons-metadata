They had marched overnight on the 3rd october and at 6.10am the following morning they advanced between Le Catelet and Vendhuile upon a redoubt at Richmond Copse. They had to move down the slope to the Scheldt Canal and then up the slope on the other side. They were enfiladed from both flanks, from Le Catelet and Vendhuile, but reached their objective at 7.30am. Finding themselves isolated they withdrew nearly to the start line. They took over 300 prisoners including several machine gun teams and the 4/KRRC later advanced over the same ground with very few casualties. They lost 9 officers killed, including Nicholson and Nepean; 2 officers wounded; and 139 other tanks casualties. The regimental history of the RF suggests this was the highest number of officers killed in one action by any battalion of the RF. \n\nEvan Cecil Nepean is listed on <a href=\"http://www.thepeerage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.thepeerage.com</a> <a href=\"http://thepeerage.com/p23884.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">thepeerage.com/p23884.htm</a>\n\nAlso in the War Graves Photographic Project <a href=\"http://twgpp.org/information.php?id=2271370\" rel=\"nofollow\">twgpp.org/information.php?id=2271370</a>\n\nEvan is listed in De Ruvigny's Roll of Honour Vol 5 which states that he was killed at Le Catelet and quotes a 'brother officer' who wrote: &quot;He was one of the bravest gentlemen that ever wore the King's uniform, and his death has been felt more than anybody's. He was a grand character, brave, loyal and courteous, always thinking of his men's comfort.&quot; Another said: &quot;His loss is very great, he was so popular, and such a good soldier. He has always done well - his best. He was cheerful in all circumstances, and gallant in danger beyond anything. We have lost one of our best, one of the type we most wanted to be spared.&quot; The Chaplain wrote: &quot;Though he probably did not know it, he was a great help to me spiritually.&quot;\n\nSt Alban's, High Street War Memorial <a href=\"http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Hertfordshire/StAlbansHighStreet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.roll-of-honour.com/Hertfordshire/StAlbansHighStreet.html</a>\n\nThe London Gazette 2 Apr 1915 <a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29118/pages/3255/page.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29118/pages/3255/page.pdf</a>\n\n10484 SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 23 OCTOBER, 1915 shows him as Second Lieutenant (on probation) <a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29337/supplements/10484/page.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29337/supplements/10484/p...</a>\n\nGiven his Christian name he is probably related to Sir Evan Nepean (c.1752-1822) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Nepean\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Nepean</a> and thus loosely connected to the actor Hugh Grant!", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-8053715004-72157631774901382", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8053715004"}}
