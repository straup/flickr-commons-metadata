The hospital had beds for 20 officers on 3 wards and one private room, and its own operating theatre.  It was an Annex (what would be described today as Role 2) of Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital at Millbank.  Lady Northcliffe was appointed a Dame of the Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire for her personal nursing and administration of this hospital, and made a Dame of Grace of the order of St. John. The hospital closed in 1919 and became the London Headquarters of the British Red Cross Society.  It is today the offices of a legal firm, Child &amp; Child.\n\nMrs Audubon's excellent piece of research would suggest that Frederic Newhouse was probably wounded in France or Belgium in 1915, possibly at Loos in September 1915, while serving with 3rd Cavalry Division, and evacuated to 'Blighty' to recover at Lady Northcliffe's hospital.\n\nThe Anglo-French forces in Salonika deployed to fight the Bulgarians from October 1915.  By December 1916 British troops there amounted to six divisions, forming XVI Corps, with the General Headquarters, GHQ, of the British Salonika Army established in Salonika from January 1917 under a Royal Artillery officer, General Sir George Milne DSO, later Chief of the Imperial General Staff (1926-1933).  \n\nIt is likely that Captain Newhouse was posted out to Salonika once he was fit again for front line duty in mid to late 1916 or early 1917.  General Milne often selected his Special Service Intelligence Officers and Staff of the General Staff Intelligence from personal acquaintance or individual recommendation, (Capt L C M S Amery ROYAL WARWICKS; Capt J A L Caunter MC* GLOSTERS; Col A Rawlinson Late MIDDLESEX).  At some point Lt Frederic Newhouse RE may have come to his attention.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8054112206-72157631752046203", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8054112206"}}
