On 11th September they entrained at Pont-des-Briques for Watten; on arrival being billeted at Bayenghem-les-Eperlecques.  The Battalion undertook further battle training before marching up towards the front line.  On 24th September 1915 they bivouacked at Fours-a-Chaux, one and a half miles from Noeux-les-Mines, having moved via Racquinghem, Norrent, and Cauchy-a-la-Tour.   On 25th September, as part of 63rd Brigade, 21st Division, they were warned for firing line duty at 10.30 am and moved up to Vermelles at 2.30 pm under artillery fire where they relieved a battalion of 15th Division at 7.10 pm, with 8th Somerset Light Infantry on their right. \n\nOn 26th and 27th September 8th Lincolnshire were heavily engaged in the Battle of Loos.  Total casualties from 48 hours of intensive action were: 22 Officers and 471 Other Ranks, killed, wounded, missing and prisoners (of a total of 28 Officers and 995 ORs).  On 28th September the survivors of the Battalion were mustered in the support trenches and left Vermelles for the rear, proceeding by road and rail to Linghem.  It is likely that Pte William Thomas Thompson was only officially reported as missing at the first full Battalion muster parade after the battle, on 29th September 1915.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8358485344-72157632660930807", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8358485344"}}
