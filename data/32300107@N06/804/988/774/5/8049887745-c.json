They initially trained in Post Office uniforms on the Earl Yarborough's estate at Brocklesby.  In May 1915, equipped with rifles and in proper uniforms, the battalion went to Ripon in North Yorkshire for skill at arms training, and then, with other elements of 101st Brigade of 34th Division, to Sutton Veney on Salisbury Plain.  At one time warned for service in the Dardanelles, but then stood down, the men of 10th Lincolns were anxious that the war would be over before they were ready for deployment.  (They eventually embarked for France in January 1916 - to suffer terrible casualties on the first day of the Somme on 1st July 1916).\n\nRapidly promoted to Corporal, Frank Tilbrook was meanwhile selected for officer training and was commissioned into 7th Durham Light Infantry on 1st August 1915, but immediately volunteered for secondment to the Royal Engineers.  His attachment to 231 Fd Coy RE being published in the London Gazette of 8th September 1915, to be effective from 9th September 1915.  231 Fd Coy, raised in Doncaster, (together with 224 Fd Coy and 229 Fd Coy), was assigned to the recently formed 40th Division (a 5th New Army Division) and landed in France on 10th November 1916.\n\n231 Fd Coy RE initially saw operations during 1917 in the Ancre area.  On 3rd December 1917 they moved to Cambrai.  When the Ludendorff Spring Offensive struck on 21st March 1918, 231 Fd Coy moved to St Quentin, and then withdrew on 24th March to Bapaume, before being rushed forward into action at Estaires on 9th April 1918. \n\nThe massed German attack on the British line, Operation Georgette, later described as the Battle of the Lys, commenced with the Battle of Estaires 9-11 Apr 1918.  The German attack opened at 7am on 9th April 1918 with heavy gas and HE shelling, heralding German infantry assaults streaming forward using 'Hutier tactics' to storm the British positions under cover of thick fog.  231 Field Company would have been committed to the denial of crossings over the Rivers Lawe and Lys, by demolition of bridges, whilst enabling the infantry of 40th Division to withdraw in contact over reserved demolitions and temporary bridging - specifically around Bac St Maur.  It is of note that Lieutenant Mark Christopher Ball RE of 231 Fd Coy RE was killed in action on 9th April 1918.\n\nA/Capt Tilbrook is noted elsewhere as having died of wounds on 10th April 1918, it is likely that he was mortally wounded during the actions by 231 Fd Coy on 9th April.  \n\nLance Corporal George William Beighton and Sapper Percy Horner of 231 Fd Coy RE were respectively awarded the French Croix de Guerre and Belgian Croix de Guerre for their gallantry at this time [LG 19 Jun 1919 and LG 4 Sep 1919].  Company Sergeant Major A C Stead and Corporal R W Burne of 231 Fd Coy both received the Meritorious Service Medal [LG 18 Jan 1919].
