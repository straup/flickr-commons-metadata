Corporal Bartlett is wearing an infantry qualification badge on his right cuff, a star, which (I think) shows him to be a First Class Shot.  He is also wearing 1908 pattern webbing equipment as opposed to the leather equipment issued from 1914.  The 'sock' is simply a customised protection to prevent mud getting into the breech &amp; bolt mechanism or the rifle magazine.  The rifle may of course be a photographer's 'prop', but the 'sock' and tunnel foresight suggest that this is Corporal Bartlett's personal weapon.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7921758084-72157631510308913", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921758084/#comment72157631510336092", "realname": "Willem", "path_alias": null, "author": "32921850@N00", "iconserver": "7439", "datecreate": "1347360576", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/69679868@N03] Thank you for elaborating on this, Gary.
