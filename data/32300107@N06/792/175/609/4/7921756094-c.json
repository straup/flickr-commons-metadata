They actually faced the village of Flers with the 122nd (Left) and 124th (Right) Brigades in the frontline. \n\nThe 124th Brigade had the 10th Queens and the 21 KRRC leading the attack and the brigade was given the task of turning right after Flers to move onto Guedecourt. The front waves formed up in no man's land and they advanced behind a creeping barrage. Some of the men were so eager that they were killed by their own barrage. \n\nThe 124th Brigade managed to capture Tea Support and the Switch Line by 7 a.m. and by 7.20 a.m. Flers Trench had also fell with parties of the brigade moving onto their third objective. \n\nThis brigade was unable to move much further than this. By 3.20 p.m. around 200 men from both the 10th Queens and the 21st KRRC made one more attampt to move onto Bulls Road led by Lt Col Oakley and the Earl of Faversham. The brigade commnader also ordered two companies of the 23rd Middlesex to support them. \n\nIn this advance the Earl of Faversham was killed but they managed to occupy the western edge of Bulls Road and make contact with the 122nd Brigade. Any further advance on Gird trench was stopped by machine gun fire. They held here and all further attacks for the day were stopped. Counter attacks were stopped by what was by now a very weak 124th Brigade and they were eventually relieved by the 123rd Brigade which began to take over the whole of the 41st Division's front.", "authorname": "Steve Smith 1944", "id": "32254785-7921756094-72157631917558387", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921756094/#comment72157631918260120", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osborne_villas", "author": "73313451@N00", "iconserver": "3822", "datecreate": "1351949715", "_content": "It appears the witness to his oath was his tutor Reverend J P Brocklehurst.
