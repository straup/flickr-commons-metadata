L Escombe, born Bromley, was recorded at The Manor House, Main Street, Stanstead St Margarets, Hertfordshire. This was the household of his parents, Rowland L, (aged 38 and a Ship Broker from Surbiton, Surrey) and Mary M. (aged 36, from Clapton, London). They also had a daughter living with them, Aileen B L, (aged 6 and born Bromley), as well as 6 live in servants.\n\nOn the 1911 census, there is a William Malcolm Lingard Escombe, born circa 1892 Bromley, who was recorded in the Lewisham District.\n\nA blog adds a bit more detail - father was &quot;Ronland&quot; Lingard Escombe, mother was Mary Magretha Lingard, the daughter was Aileen Barbara Lingard Escombe. Williams home address was 38 Lee Terrace, Blackheath, Lee and he worked as a clerk at his fathers ship broker business.\n<a href=\"http://www.20thlondonregiment.com/william-malcolm-lingard-escombe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.20thlondonregiment.com/william-malcolm-lingard-escomb...</a>\n\nIn the edition of the London Gazette dated 17th March 1911, it was announced that William Malcolm Lingard Escombe, late Cadet Colour Sergeant, Bradfield College Contingent, Junior Division, Officer Training Corps, had been appointed 2nd Lieutenant in the 20th (County of London)Battalion, The London Regiment, with effect from 14th February 1911.\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28476/pages/2238\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28476/pages/2238</a>\n\nThe promotion of William from 2nd Lieutenant to Lieutenant in the 20th Battalion, London Regiment, effective 20th July 1912, was reported in the London Gazette, dated 8th November 1912\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28661/pages/8208\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28661/pages/8208</a>\n\nThe marriage of a William M L Escombe to an Eileen M Love took place in the Lewisham District in the October to December 1915 quarter, (may be a co-incidence !)\n\nHis temporary acting promotion to Captain from Lieutenant was made permanent and backdated to the 1st June 1916 in the London gazette published on the 17th April 1917.

His prompt action not only repelled a hostile attack, but secured fresh ground, which was consolidated.\u2019\n\nM.I.D. London Gazette 1 January 1916.\n\nCaptain William Malcolm Lingard Escombe was born at Bromley, Kent in 1891 and educated at Bradfield College. He was commissioned into the 20th London Regiment in March 1911 and served on the Western Front from March 1915 until 25 September 1915 when he received a gunshot wound to his right arm at the Battle of Loos. In December 1916 he was appointed Assistant Instructor at the 2nd Army Central School, British Expeditionary Force, being transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1919. He joined the Hertfordshire Constabulary in May 1926 attaining the rank of Superintendent in 1933, before retiring in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. He then pursued a career in local politics serving as Chairman of the St Albans (Parliamentary) Division of the Conservative and Unionist Association.\n\nCaptain Escombe published a nine page account of his part in the Battle of Loos from which the following is extracted: \u2018At last the moment that we have waited for for six weeks arrives. We adjust our smoke helmets ready to pull down at a moment\u2019s notice. Suddenly the word comes, \u201cIt\u2019s started\u201d. A hasty glance over the parapet shows a thick brown cloud emerging from the front line. The next moment there is the crack of a Boche rifle, then another and another, then dozens, then hundreds and machine guns as well. The bullets crackle and whistle over our heads in a storm. Up go the rockets and star shells and then the Boche guns start. With a shriek and a roar the shells arrive. Faster and aster they come. HE shrapnel, big stuff, small stuff, pip-squeaks, 77s, 5-9s, tearing the air to ribbons, scattering the earth clouds, smothering the atmosphere with fumes, dust and flying fragments. One gun or battery in particular persistently puts HE\u2019s about 50 yards beyond my bit of trench showering us with dirt each time. A bit of spent shrapnel hits me thud on the shoulder but has not the force to go through my clothing. Then a bit of dirt hits the rim of my goggles as I hold them in my hand and knocks the glass out \u2013 a serious accident this, but with Andy\u2019s help I am able to replace it. Our own guns have now worked themselves into a frenzy, and the din is awful. I glance constantly at my watch. It seems impossible for anyone to get out on top and live, but my mind goes back to accounts of previous battles. How often is that phrase used; and yet men do get through, so why shouldn\u2019t some of us? \nSix-thirty at last. \u201cThere\u2019re off\u201d the news flashes along the line. I glance over the top and there in the dense smoke are the Irish advancing in line. Weird and uncanny they look \u2013 mere shadows in the curling yellow fog \u2013 but they never hesitate; each line adjusts itself and disappears. Here indeed is borne the fruit of all that training at Hatfield, St Albans, and in our days of \u2018rest\u2019 behind the line; for nothing but the absolute habit of moving in line at five paces interval could enable men to do so under these hellish conditions.\n\nThere goes our front line, now the second and third \u2013 our turn next. We scramble over the parapet and out of the saps, stumble through a few strands of wire and throw ourselves down for a brief pause. Then up and we double forward as fast as we can, jumping our supernumerary and front lines or crossing them by the bridges placed there by our men before they left. We must get clear our lines as quickly as possible as that is where the shells are falling thickest. My helmet hampers my breathing considerably and once clear of the front line I am glad to break into quick time. I can see Andy beside me but we have to shout to make each other hear. It is not possible to recognise men at a few yards owing to their helmets and the smoke. \n\nThe air seems to whiz past me with bullets, but I hardly notice anyone falling. Suddenly my outlet valve becomes choked and refuses to work. I can\u2019t get my breath fast enough; in vain I gasp \u2013 my lungs are empty. But for Andy I should fall. I feel I must drop just where I am and rest, but he clutches my arm. My only hope is to raise my helmet and chance the gas. I can see others doing it and tear mine off. A few deep breaths of cool air revive me and as there is no gas to hurt I can push on. Now I find myself in the Boche wire, but luckily I strike an easy place and get through without trouble, though I can see men dropping all around. A grenade pitches amongst a group of men on my left. I can see the hole it blows in the ground. The men seem to hesitate and then fall, but I hear no sound \u2013 the general roar of battle drowns everything. The Boche front line at last \u2013 I hurl myself over it but the parados gives and I slip back. There is a dug-out behind me into which the Irish have driven some Germans.\n\nI take a chance shot down the entrance before willing hands heave me up again and Andy pulls me to my feet and on we go. It is still impossible to see more than a few hundred yards. I try to find Tower Bridge or cassier to check my position, but I cannot see them, so I drop down and take a compass bearing \u2013 we are too far left. Now we cross a track and reach a communication trench. I rack my brains to think where they come in on the map. A Boche is located in this trench, but the lines sweep on. Here I recognise some of my men, P.C. Litten amongst them.\n\nAgain I drop down to take a bearing and then thud \u2013 something hits me a stinging blow on the right arm just below the shoulder. I am hit, I tell Andy but get up. He helps me into the trench and rips up my sleeve. My arm is bleeding a bit but he soon binds it up and it doesn\u2019t hurt much. I have a drink of water and after a few minutes I feel better though a bit shaky. We move along the trench a bit and then climb out. Andy wants me to go back, but I must get to the Garden City and find the Company. He takes my arm and tries to make me go back with him \u2013 I think he thinks I am worse than I really am \u2013 but I order him to come with me, and then guided by the Tower Bridge which now shows up, we make for the Garden City. We were too far left as I thought and as there seems to be a good deal of fire coming from Loos we follow a communication trench past the second line.\n\nWe can see our men in the Cit and after about ten minutes we join them. They have practically cleared the whole place out and are now working through the neighbouring trenches and consolidating. Bell has got a platoon, or rather, what remains of it on the crassier on the left, exactly as arranged, and \u2018A\u2019 Company has pushed on about a quarter of a mile up the slope of hill 70 and is digging in. The line is very thin though....\n\nIt is Sunday morning \u2013 just a week since I went for a ride \u2013 and here I am eating breakfast in the open with green woods rising above the quiet little village and a church bell ringing. Faintly through the calm air comes the far away rumble of guns, where the remnant of my devoted regiment is still carrying on the struggle. A squadron of cavalry moves along dusty roads. At midday the long hospital train moves slowly out of the siding and I am on it. Many are the encouraging rumours that have reached us and our spirits are high \u2013 for surely we have got through this time. Not till we reach England some two days later do we begin to learn how once more we have failed. Not through any fault of the 47th Division though.\u2019\n\nSold with the following original documentation: A studio portrait photograph of recipient in uniform wearing D.S.O. ribbon; two letters to recipients father advising him that his son had been wounded in action \u2018gunshot wound in right arm\u2019; news cutting relating to recipients wedding; photograph of recipient whilst Superintendent, Hertfordshire Constabulary and a typescript curriculum vitae prepared by recipient in 1953. \n \n<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m2nqfvdygiYJ:http://www.dnw.co.uk/medals/auctionarchive/searchcataloguearchive/itemdetail.lasso?itemid=64654+Escombe+CBE&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;surl=1&amp;gs_l=heirloom-serp.3...42204.46704.0.47657.9.9.0.0.0.0.406.1655.2-2j2j1.5.0...0.0...1c.1.kYj3hjy6Ka8&amp;ct=clnk\" rel=\"nofollow\">webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m2nqfvdygiY...</a>\n\nThey had previously been sold by Spinks in 1999. Their description added that:-\nSold with an interesting series of Great War maps, several annotated by the recipient, including 'Neuve Chapelle, May-June 1915', 'High Wood, Sept.-Oct. 1916', 'Hooge, Aug.-Sept. 1915', 'Bourlon Wood, Nov.-Dec. 1917'; together with one or two portrait photographs and original Territorial Force Record Office letters regarding the recipient's wounds (both dated June 1915).\n\nProceeding to France in March 1915, he won his D.S.O. for bravery as a Company Commander that May. Seriously wounded by a gunshot wound in the right arm at Loos in late September, he was evacuated to England via No. 9 Stationary Hospital at Le Havre a few days later. For the remainder of hostilities, Escombe served as an Instructor to the 2nd Army and transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1919.\n\nIn later life, in addition to being Managing Director of the family firm Escombe McGraph Co. Ltd., he rose to the rank of Superintendent in the Hertfordshire Special Constabulary and commanded over 200 men in a 40 square mile area in the 1939-45 War. Escombe was additionally a Master of the Merchant Taylor's Company and Chairman - and latterly President - of the St. Albans Parliamentary Division, Conservative Unionist Association. He died in November 1973, having described his principal pursuit as 'making both ends meet', and his sporting achievements as 'getting married on his Army pay'. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1631236\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intO...</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-7921759648-72157631599248837", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921759648/#comment72157631598906506", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "43688219@N00", "iconserver": "87", "datecreate": "1348359851", "_content": "His DSO report in the London Gazette\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29240/supplements/7280/page.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29240/supplements/7280/pa...</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-7921759648-72157631598906506", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921759648/#comment72157631599349889", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "43688219@N00", "iconserver": "87", "datecreate": "1348360887", "_content": "The 1915 diary of a 2nd Lieutenant Robert Peyton Hamilton of the same battalion contains several references to an &quot;Escombe&quot;\n\nThe entry for the 28th May reads\nFri. 28 Fairly quiet night; couldn't sleep, though, and took everybody's duty.
