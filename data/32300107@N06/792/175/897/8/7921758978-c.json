Private Thomas Harry Evans is in a hot climate uniform, proudly displaying his Good Conduct chevrons on his left cuff (2 chevrons for 6 years Good Conduct).  The distinctive 'Back Badge' of the Glosters is clearly visible on his Solar Topee.  The silver tipped cane and the rather ostentatious Aguillette Cords were presumably the photographer's props to 'glam up' the portrait.  Pte Evans is also apparently wearing a professional qualification badge on his right upper sleeve.  The Battalion was back in England, at Bordon, by 1913.  This presumably places the photograph before that date - but after 1909. //", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7921758978-72157631536267315", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921758978/#comment72157631539909991", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1347701455", "_content": "Thomas Harry Evans was born in Gloucester between April and June 1887.  The stated length of his Service suggests that he enlisted as a 'Boy Soldier' in the Gloucestershire Regiment in 1903 aged 16 and probably went out to Lahore or Dalhousie in India.  The Battalion returned to barracks in Portsmouth in 1910, which might narrow down the date of the photograph to 1909-1910, when Pte Evans was aged 22-23.\n\nOn 29th October 1914, 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment was defending the Kruisecke Crossroads on the Menin Road between Gheluvelt and Ploogsteert Wood against a determined attack by Bavarian infantry of the German Army intent on breaking the British Line and capturing Ypres.  The ferocity of this defence is reflected in the numbers of officers and men of 1 GLOSTERS killed in action over the three days 29th to 31st October 1914.  The British line was forced back towards Gheluvelt, but it did not break.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7921758978-72157631539909991", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7921758978/#comment72157631776620357", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1350320260", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.cwgc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cwgc.org</a> has <a href=\"http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1611797/EVANS, THOMAS HARRY\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1611797/EVANS,%20THOM...</a>\nRank:Private\nService No:7233\nDate of Death:29/10/1914\nAge:27\nRegiment/Service:Gloucestershire Regiment &quot;D&quot; Coy. 1st Bn. \nPanel ReferencePanel 22 and 34.\nMemorial YPRES (MENIN GATE) MEMORIAL\nAdditional Information:11 years service.\n\nThe database of UK Soldiers Died in the Great War gives his place of birth as Saintsbridge (sic), Gloucestershire.
