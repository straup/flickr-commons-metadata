We reached the German first and second line in quick time, and we had been there for some time when they started to shell us very heavily, and I lost my men nearly. Your brother was in the second line when he was killed with two more men. They all died together I am sorry to say. Willie was a great pal of mine. We had spent some time in the trenches together. You will see where I am and I should like to see you.\u201d \n\nIn another letter to a friend of Willie\u2019s at Brockholes the same corporal wrote:\n\n\u201cThree of my men were done with the same shell. He was killed instantly and his comrades with him, and I was wounded soon after. I was struck by a bomb and had to get away the best way I could. We lost very heavily and a lot of the wounded were taken prisoners. We lost all our officers.\u201d\nThe inof relates to action taken by the Duke of Wellington\u2019s West Riding Division on the 3rd Sept 1916, so this may well be the same Willie / William Lawton.", "authorname": "liits", "id": "32254785-7920348348-72157631402235094", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "7920348348"}}
