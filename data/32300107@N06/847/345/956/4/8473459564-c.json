His father might be a Cecil William Battine and his mother Margaret Louisa (nee Orde)?  This Nigel Battine was from London, born 24 Oct 1898; he married a Rosalind M H Burn; and he died in 1950.  Nigel Battine had a brother, Oswald James Battine, b. 1904-d. 1938.  It appears that Nigel Battine achieved the rank of Commander before leaving the Royal Navy.\n\nNigel Battine is mentioned by Agatha Christie in her memoir &quot;The Grand Tour: Letters and photographs from the British Empire Expedition 1922&quot;, as follows:  'Saturday February 18th - at dinner with Mrs Blake'  &quot;Nigel Battine, the Flag Lieut. completed the party, and afterwards we motored out to Wynberg where there was a dance on.  I enjoyed myself enormously, Battine, who is quite an amusing youth with no mean opinion of himself, confided to us that the Admiral had worn the wrong hat at the garden party, and that he feared there would be trouble about it in the morning!&quot;//\n\n... and thank you to the IWM sponsor researchers who posted this photo into the portfolio on St Valentine's Day!  The complement of HMS Valentine, who of course referred to themselves as &quot;Valentines&quot;,  would have appreciated the sentiment.  Well done!.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8473459564-72157632764985333", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8473459564"}}
