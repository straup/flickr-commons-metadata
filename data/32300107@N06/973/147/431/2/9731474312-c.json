This was the household of his old sister, Helen, aged 22 and from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland. Helen had other siblings in her care:-\nGladys.........aged 18...........born Newcastle upon Tyne\nErin..............aged 16..........born Newbiggin-by-the-Sea\nMary E........aged 9.............born York\nRupert........aged 7.............born Axmouth\nThere are then 12 live in servants.\n\nI couldn't locate Desmond on the 1911 census initially, but the family seem no strangers to travel.\n\nApparently he was a cadet at Sandhurst in 1915.His papers there can be ordered on-line.\n<a href=\"http://archive.sandhurstcollection.co.uk/view/5441/107481/RMC_WO_151_Vol_8_1910-1917/Desmond_Allhusen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.sandhurstcollection.co.uk/view/5441/107481/RMC_WO...</a>\nA picture of the group of cadets he studied with and their subsequent fate can be seen here, (if you are a forum member)\n<a href=\"http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55389\" rel=\"nofollow\">1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55389</a>\n\nChecking out a local history site for Axmouth, the page on the church mentions this in passing.\n\n<i>Moving across the churchyard, some of the monuments to the Hallett family may be seen at the south-east corner of the Bindon Chapel.  A little further over, and close to the south wall, are some headstones erected to mark the last resting places of members of the Allhusen family, who had first come to live at Pinhay House around 1892, restoring the old name of the property.  The previous owner, Levi Ames, by now deceased, had renamed it Clevelands.  Pinhay for centuries formed the easternmost part of the old Axmouth parish, but in recent years boundaries have changed and the connection with Axmouth has been severed.</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.axmouthcommunity.org/history/churchyard/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.axmouthcommunity.org/history/churchyard/</a>\n\nI'd had a quick look down the 10 names that came up at the National Archive for Medal Index cards for the surname Allhusen.\nOnce I was aware of the family members, I took another look.\nThere are cards for a \nGladys A - Volunteer Aid Detachment, Young Mens Christian Associaton\nWO 372/23/529 \n<a href=\"http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=D6065092\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=D6...</a>\nMary E Allhusen.
