He died Sept. 15, 1918 and is buried at Rocquigny-Equancourt Road British Cemetery, Manancourt, France. This cemetery was near a casualty clearing station. The 78th Brigade RFA participated in the Battle of Havrincourt on Sept. 12, 1918 so I would guess Lt. Bingham was wounded on or around this day, transported 16km south west to the casualty clearing station at Manancourt and unfortunately passed away there 3 days later at the age of 34. He had a wife named Mabel.\n\nI hope this info is correct, As I said before, rest in peace sir and thank you.", "authorname": "stowejordan5", "id": "32254785-9731504108-72157636169204216", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/9731504108/#comment72157636169303386", "realname": "jrdn sto", "path_alias": null, "author": "104240447@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1380856507", "_content": "I would like to give credit to CWGC for some of the info included in my above comment.", "authorname": "stowejordan5", "id": "32254785-9731504108-72157636169303386", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "9731504108"}}
