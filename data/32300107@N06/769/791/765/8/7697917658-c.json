His father was an Armenian from Persia who came to Britain via the Netherlands and as a naturalised British Citizen was a succesful businessman.  He had two sisters, one a year older, Kathleen, and one 3 years younger Margaret Cicely.  The family home was at 52 Bath Road, Chiswick, London.  His widowed mother subsequently, 25 years later, married the Earl of Annesley.  This photograph, probably taken in December 1915, directly upon his Commissioning, would have been when he was 24 years old.\n\nAganoor John Aganoor attended Harrow House School at Bognor, Sussex, and Christ's Hospital ('Bluecoat') School, Horsham, West Sussex (1901-1907) where he was in Peele B House.\n\nHe initially served in the ranks of 1/16 Battalion London Regiment as No 1770.  Second Lieutenant Aganoor was killed in an attack on High Wood by 17th Londons which cost the Battalion the lives of 3 other Second Lieutenants (H J MacBeth, A G Costello, and A W King) amongst 69 killed, 191 wounded and 15 missing.\n\nHis headstone in the Caterpillar Valley CWGC Cemetery bears the inscription;  &quot;I shall remember while the light lasts and in the darkness I shall not forget&quot;.  His mother also placed an annual 'In Memoriam' notice to him in The Times on the anniversary of his death until she died in 1931.", "authorname": "Wemmbley-Hogg", "id": "32254785-7697917658-72157631122242448", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7697917658"}}
