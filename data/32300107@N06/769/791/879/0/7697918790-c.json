The family home during his youth was at Newport House on the High Street in Newport, near Saffron Walden, Essex.  After school at Winchester and Trinity Cambridge he went on to study Holy Orders at the Bishop's Hostel, Farnham, (his paternal grandfather was a clergyman).  On the outbreak of war he joined the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Sussex at Dover before being attached to the 2nd Battalion in France. He was killed in action (during a German attack near the brickstacks at Cuinchy) after only being with the Battalion a fortnight. He was buried in the Cuinchy communal cemetery.\n\nSidney had one sibling, an elder sister, Edith, b. 1887, five years older than him.\n\nThe German attack on 1st Division at the Cuinchy, between Bethune and La Bassee, on 29th January 1915, was launched on the Kaiser's birthday and was principally beaten off by 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex. Acting Company Sergeant Major Bernard Norris Butcher of the 2nd Royal Sussex won a Distinguished Conduct Medal (often regarded as a 'near miss' for a Victoria Cross) on 29th January for his leadership in the defence of 'The Keep' feature amongst the brickstacks. //", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7697918790-72157631559183453", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7697918790"}}
