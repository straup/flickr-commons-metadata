His parents were Robert Naismith [b.17/4/1848 Lanarkshire, Scotland. D.14/7/1936 Boree Creek, NSW, Australia] and Ellen nee Jones [b.29/5/1858 Chain of Ponds Victoria, Australia.

I think he came from New South Wales. I had known him for about three or four months. I was in the same platoon with him at one time and new him well. I think he came over with the 2nd reinforcements to the 56th Battalion (?) The number given is about his. I was told by Pte H McNaughton, 1942, C Co 10th platoon, that he had been one of the party who buried Naismith. McNaughton was with the battalion up to the 9th May 1917. No 2034 Pte. A. Howitt of C Co 11th platoon told me that he was also on the burial party. Howitt was with the battalion up to the 9th May 1917.&quot; Informant L/Cpl B Elliot 3034\n\n\u201cHe was killed at Louveville on the night of the 2nd April 1917 in a corrugated iron shed on the edge of a wood. We had been over the top that morning and at night about 40 of us including myself and Naismith got into this shed. After we got to sleep three shells landed in the shed in quick succession, whizz bangs I think they were, and killed every man in the shed except myself and 2 others. I got off with a scratch on the wrist. Naismith's body could only be identified by his disc. I believe that a burial party went out next night and buried all the bodies close to the shed, but the 56th had been relieved by that time. Naismith came from NSW and used to work on a farm\u201d.
