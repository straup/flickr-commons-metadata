[Supplement to London Gazette 29441 dated 17 Jan 1916].\n\n2nd Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment was in 25th Brigade in 8th Division.  On the First Day of the Somme, 1st July 1916, 2 Lincolns, commanded by Lt Col Reginald Bastard, attacked opposite Ovillers-la-Boiselle - temporarily fighting their way into the German front line fortified trenches but by 8.30am being forced back to their original start line, having suffered 64% casualties, losing 21 officers and 450 other ranks.  At 7pm that evening the battalion was relieved in place by 6th Royal West Kents.  For acts of quite astonishing bravery Lt Col Bastard was awarded a Bar to his DSO.\n\nOn 19th September 1916 2nd Lincolns went back into the front line, occupying trenches referred to as the Hohenzollern.  Given the policy of aggressive patrolling to dominate no mans land, it is likely that 2Lt Dickinson was wounded and lost on such a patrol on the night of 19/20 September.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6789451173-72157629414961503", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6789451173/#comment72157633385974464", "realname": "Darren Barton", "path_alias": "dobber31", "author": "51462208@N08", "iconserver": "5527", "datecreate": "1367314044", "_content": "My Gt Gt Grandad Joseph Staniland was killed on this night he was in the 6th Btn Lincolnshire Regiment.
