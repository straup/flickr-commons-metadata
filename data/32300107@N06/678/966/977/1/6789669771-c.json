On 10th April, 50th Division was forced back and 1st Border was thrown into the line between Bleu and Vieux Berquin sustaining such casualties that the battalion was reduced to 8 officers and 195 other ranks.  Fighting raged on 11th and 12th April with the surviving few defending positions with astonishing bravery.  Lt Col Forbes-Robertson was awarded a Victoria Cross for his conspicuous courage and leadership.  Eventually on 13th April what remained of 1st Border was re-formed into two companies in a composite battalion made up of all units of the brigade and commanded by Lt Col Murray of 1 KOSB and were eventually brought out of action on 17th April, being relieved by French troops.  The 1st Border companies moved back to La Brearde, but there occupied quarters that were constantly under German artillery fire.\n\nConsidering the dates of the fighting at Vieux Berquin and the apparent date of 2Lt Olden's death, he may have been mortally wounded at Vieux Berquin and died subsequently, or otherwise been reported missing in that action and, on 4 May 1918, finally accepted as klilled in action.  With such heavy casualties and inevitable chaos of gathering up survivors into a composite battalion, absolutely accurate reporting in a desperate situation would have been impossible.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6789669771-72157629358442529", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6789669771/#comment72157629358834541", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1329497514", "_content": "This photograph was taken at the main studio of Jasper Weston &amp; Son Photographers at  20A Sandgate Road, Folkestone - the Westons being a strongly Quaker family and well known photographers with successful studios in Dover, Eastbourne, Folkestone and St Leonards on Sea.
