Under cover of a heavy barrage the enemy attacked, very quickly surrounding a strong point, where this officer had his company headquarters and one platoon. In face of superior numbers, he put up a stout resistance until forced to retire on to another strong point, where the position was very critical, the officer in charge having been killed. He took command, and after a stiff fight, drove back the enemy.
