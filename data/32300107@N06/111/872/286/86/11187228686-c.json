Most of her fiction was written under the pseudonym &quot;Jeanie Hering&quot;.\nAs the mother of six she undertook a journey of 500 miles in about 7 weeks from Arran to Dorset, with the poor nurse Ellen having to push the one-year-old in a perambulator. The story of the journey became her last book, being published in 1894 as Adventures of a Perambulator.\n&quot;All Jeanie's boys survived the war.&quot;\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Adams-Acton\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Adams-Acton</a>\n\nHis father John Adams-Acton was a famous sculptor.\nA sister of John, &quot;Clarissa, engaged in art and exhibited at the Royal Academy. To avoid confusion with other artists of the same name, Adams adopted in 1869 the additional surname of Acton from his birthplace.\n\n&quot;He executed the Wesley memorial in Westminster Abbey, the Cruikshank memorial in St. Paul's Cathedral, the statue of Wesley before the City Road chapel, and the memorial of Cardinal Manning in the new Roman Catholic Cathedral at Westminster. He also executed a colossal statue of Sir Titus Salt, erected near Bradford Town Hall in 1874, and statues of Queen Victoria for Kingston and the Bahamas, of Mr. Gladstone, a close friend and the godfather of his fourth son, for Blackburn and Liverpool, and of Bishop Waldegrave for Carlisle Cathedral. Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, sat to him many times, and the Emperor and Empress Frederick of Germany showed interest in his art. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy till 1892, sending there statues or busts of Gladstone (1865, 1868, 1869, 1873, 1879), Lord Brougham (1867, 1868), John Bright (1870), Charles Dickens (1871), Charles Spurgeon (1874), Earl Russell (1874), Archbishop Manning (1884), the earl of Beaconsfield (1885), and Leo XII (1888). Others who sat to him were Canon Duckworth, Lord Shaftesbury Dr. Parker, Mr. Fawcett, Lord Napier of Magdala, Cobden, Lord Roberts, Dean Farrar, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Sir Isaa Holden, Sir Edwin Landseer, and many leading academicians. Of his ideal work the best were The First Sacrifice,' 'The Lady of the Lake,' 'Pharaoh's Daughter, 'Zenobia,' and 'The Millennium.'\n\n&quot;Acton's last work, which was left unfinished, was a small figure of 'The Ange of Peace.' He died at his wife's home Ormidale, Brodick, in the Isle of Arran which he visited every summer, on 28 Oct 1910.\n\n&quot;Acton married on 15 Aug. 1875, at St. Mark's Church, Hamilton Terrace, London Marion Hamilton of the Isle of Arran, an authoress writing under the name 'Jeannie Hering.' He had four sons and three daughters. Two of his sons, Harold and Murray, practised their father's art.&quot;\nDictionary of National Biography, 1912 Supplement\n<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adams-Acton,_John_(DNB12)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adams-Acton,_John_%28DNB12%29</a>", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-11187228686-72157638521853906", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/11187228686/#comment72157638522824756", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1386622097", "_content": "A son died in WII:\nPvt Murray Adams-Acton \nBirth: unknown\nDeath: Aug. 22, 1944\nNote: Private, 12th (10th Battalion, The Green Howards [Yorkshire Regiment]) Battalion, Parachute Regiment, A.A.C.
