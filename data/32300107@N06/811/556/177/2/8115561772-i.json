Hope Nelson was born on 26 February 1883. He was married and came from Wellesbourne Hall, Wellesbourne, Warwick. \n\nHe served with the 12th Royal Lancers as a second lieutenant. He was given 6 weeks sick leave in July 1916 suffering from asthma, being given permission to spend his leave at Mont Dore, France. \n\nA medical board on 23 October 1916 found him to be unfit for general and home service for 2 months and light duties for 1 month. After having taken all the full sick pay to which he was entitled, Hope Nelson was informed that his commission was to be relinquished. \n\nThis occured on 28 November 1916, although he was informed that should his health improve, an application for a re-appointment would be given consideration. \n\nOn 16 December 1916 Lieutenant Colonel W Kirk, Commanding 6th Reserve Cavalry based at Castleknock, Dublin, provided a letter for Hope Nelson, stating that he had\n \n'...seen a medical certification for Hope Nelson, and that he would be most useful to me if he can be recommissioned and posted to the unit under my command. I consider him a good officer and also a good horse-master which, owing to the present state of affairs, is a very important qualification.'\n\nThe re-appointment of his commission as second lieutenant with 6th Reserve Cavalry was confirmed in January 1917. He joined for duty on 11 January 1917 at the Curragh. \n\nHe was later in the 1st Reserve Regiment of Royal Lancers until August 1917 when he was ordered to proceed to the Eastern Command Depot, Eastbourne, to report for duty there in 361st Reserve Employment Company of the Labour Corps. He was later stationed with the Labour Corps at Clonmel, County Tipperary. \n\nAn annoucement of a Receiving Order in Bankruptcy appeared in London Gazette against Hope Nelson in February 1918. \n\nThis Order was rescinded by Order of the Court dated 20 March 1918 and his services retained in the Army. All debts were paid by Hope Nelson and his father.\n\nIn December 1918, his commission was relinquished on the grounds of ill-health. The honorary rank of lieutenant was conferred up on him.\n\n<b>Faces of the First World War</b>\nThe full story is not always known to us.
