His certificate was taken on Maurice Farham Biplane at the Military School, Brooklands on 25th January 1915. At that time he was a 2nd Lieut in the Durham Light Infantry. His address was given as 136 Shooter's Hill, Blackheath.\nHis Wikipedia entry refers to the MC citation:\n\nBefore ever scoring an aerial victory, he won the Military Cross (gazetted on 29 October 1915). The citation to the MC tells the tale:\n \n&quot;For conspicuous gallantry on several occasions, notably the following: \u2014\n \n&quot;On 10 September 1915, he went out to attack an observation balloon shed with a 100-lb. bomb, but, being heavily fired at by an anti-aircraft battery, he silenced the guns with this bomb and returned for another one, with which he attacked the balloon. He only narrowly missed it as it was being deflated beside the shed.\n \n&quot;On 23 September he made two determined attacks on trains from 500 feet, breaking the rails in two places. On the first occasion he returned to the attack three times, and finally climbed to 1,000 feet in order to make better use of his bomb sight; on the second occasion he made most of his return journey at 1,000 feet in order better to examine villages, roads, etc.\n \n&quot;On 25 September he attacked a train at 500 feet under heavy rifle fire, and damaged the line. Late in the afternoon of 25 September he heard that trains were moving at 25 miles distance, and, in spite of darkness and bad weather, he volunteered to attack them. Heavy rain prevented his reaching them, so he turned to attack Peronne station, descending to 500 feet and coming under heavy anti-aircraft gun fire. This fire prevented his reaching the station, but he climbed to 1,500 feet and attacked a &quot;Rocket&quot; battery, silencing one of its guns.&quot; \n\nThe National Probate Calendar shows that he died on 12th December 1952 at Tamboers-Kloof Nursing Home In Cape Town, South Africa. His address in London was given as The International Sportsmens Club, Upper Grosvenor Road.
