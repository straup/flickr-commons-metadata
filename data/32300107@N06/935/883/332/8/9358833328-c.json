His occupation was Barrister. he gave his next of kin as his father, Henry Yule Braddon of &quot;Rohini&quot;, Turramurra, New South Wales. His educational qualification was a Law Degree from Sydney University.He was born 20th March 1893.\n\nAt his medical he was 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighed 132lbs, had brown hair, a dark complexion and Hazel eyes.\n\nInitally a Gunner, he was promoted Corporal on the 1.4.1916 and then Acting Sergeant on the 5.7.1916.\n\nHis commission application is dated the 1.8.1916, at which point he was serving with the 116th Howitzer Battery. His fathers address is now given as c\\o the Australian Trade Commission, 61 Broadway, New York, USA.\n\nHe sailed from Sydney on the 30.9.1916, and arrived at Plymouth in the UK on the 19.11.1916. Initially he attended what looks like a &quot;Range Finder&quot; Course, before leaving for France on the 23.4.1917, arriving at Etaples the same day. He then bounced between various holding camps and units, finally being taken on the strength of the 13th battery on the 19.5.1917. \n\nHe seems to have spent most of September and October in hospital being treated for P.U.O.(aka Pyrexia of unknown Origins which is doctors speak for you've got a fever but we don't know whats causing it !) During this time his promotion to Lieutenant was confirmed. After a convalescence, he was posted on the 25.10.1917 to 14th Battery, stationed in Belgium.\n\n1918 was broken up by attending the Gas School, a period as Orderley Officer  and spells of leave, either in the UK or Paris.\nHis health deteriorated towards the end of the year (internal piles claimed another victim), and following the ceasing of hostilities he went before a medical board.\n\nThere is a form covering assistance with finding him post-war employment - he was found a place on a course with The Council for Legal Education, Lincolns Inn, London in May 1919, but unfortunately the course was cancelled after three weeks. The report from his tutors was that he had made very good use of his time and opportunities, gaining very useful experience.\n\nOn the 20.5.1919 it looks like he sailed for America at his own expense - he had been given a 90 days leave of absense conditional on him reporting in Sydney by the end of that period.\n\nHe actually appeared before a discharge medical board in Sydney at the end of August 1919, and made a statement that he had suffered no disability as a result of his war service. His discharge was confirmed.\n\nHe also had a brother Paul Dudley Braddon, a Medical Student who served with the Australian Army Service Corps.\n<a href=\"http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=3108184\" rel=\"nofollow\">recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/ItemDetail.a...</a>\nHe too was commissioned and served in France.He returned to Australia in March 1919.\n\nThe New South Wales State Archive has a picture of a Doctor Paul Dudley Brannon, although its not currently available to view on line.\n<a href=\"http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/items/387570;jsessionid=5C1286A4F574EC1141E28EEC8D482490\" rel=\"nofollow\">search.records.nsw.gov.au/items/387570;jsessionid=5C1286A...</a>\n\nThe is an article in a newspaper from 1963 following Paul's death, here.\n<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19630829&amp;id=1H1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3271,4375089\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19630829&amp;...</a>\nIt states he was the son of Sir Henry Braddon, a well known Sydney businessman. The Braddon family is a well known Australian family, one of whose members helped frame the first Federal Constitution and had a Canberra suburb named in his honor. \n\nThe National Archives of Australia have the same picture of Harry posted on Flickr :-)\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/national-archives-of-australia/6456083051/\">www.flickr.com/photos/national-archives-of-australia/6456...</a>\n\nFrom a family genealogy site.\n\nHenry Yule Braddon (son of Amy Georgina Palmer) was born 27 April 1863 in India, and died 8 September 1955 in Woollahra Sydney N.S.W..
