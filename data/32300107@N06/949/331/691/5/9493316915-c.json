The collar badges are distinctly those of the West Yorkshire Regiment and definitely not the York and Lancs.  There is a record of a Second Lieutenant Leonard Ashworth of the West Yorkshire Regiment reported Missing in Action on 7th January 1918, but then annotated 'Repatriated' 7th January 1918. (Forces War Records).  There is no record of a corresponding Leonard Ashworth at the CWGC website.  There are two Leonard Ashworths awarded Silver War Badges in acknowledgement of their Service.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-9493316915-72157635095062022", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/9493316915/#comment72157635103849636", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1376692522", "_content": "Leonard Ashworth's commission in the West Yorkshire Regiment is published in the Supplement to the London Gazette of 6th July 1916 at page 6733.\n\nHe has the look of a man in his late twenties, but possibly tempered by previous service and front line experience.  My guess would be that he is an officer commissioned from the ranks after volunteering as a Private soldier in the early days of the war.  He may therefore have been serving other than in the West Yorkshire Regiment prior to his selection for commission.  There are two likely Leonard Ashworths who stand out as 'possibles'; one born 1890 at East Retford in Nottinghamshire, and the other born 1891 at Haslingdean in Lancashire.\n\nThe other soldiers commissioned into the West Yorkshires in the same Gazette may provide a further clue.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-9493316915-72157635103849636", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "9493316915"}}
