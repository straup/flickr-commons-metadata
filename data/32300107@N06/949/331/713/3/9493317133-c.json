In the case of Lieutenant Charles Frederick Bilson RE it was recognised with the award of a Military Cross on 9th January 1918, the citation for which reads as follows:\n\nT/Lt Charles Frederick Bilson. RE,\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.  He took charge of a convoy which had failed three times under enemy shelling to get their loads through, and by his personal example and power of command over men who belonged to a unit not his own, succeeded at the fourth attempt in getting the wagons to their destination.  On another occasion he carried out personal and fearless daylight reconnaissances under continuous sniping and machine-gun fire, and sent in accurate and useful reports as to the position of our front line.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-9493317133-72157635234761684", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/9493317133/#comment72157636205522805", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1380960261", "_content": "Source FreeBMD:\nBilson Charles Frederick Birth registered 3rd qr 1889 Edmonton 3a 289\nBilson Charles F Marriage to Ada Nunn registered 4th qr 1914 Islington 1b 763\n\nBilson Peter C mother Nunn Birth registered 3rd qr 1918 Oxford 3a 1502\nBilson William A R Nunn Birth registered 3rd qr 1922 Sheppey 2a 1815\n\nBilson Charles F Died age 58 Death registered 2nd qr 1948 Sunderland 1a 909\nAda's probable birth and death dates 1880 (Islington) to 1958 (Kettering)", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-9493317133-72157636205522805", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "9493317133"}}
