Evans, who is on the Delhi Durbar Medal 1911 roll as Major, 12/RFA. This is the only 'Evans' on the roll as an Officer, RA. The photo shows Evans wearing the medal ribbon, so I'd assume the photo was taken between 1911 and issue of 1st War medals/date of rise to Lt Col. Caveat that there are cases of those not on the roll who obtained and wore the medal, as serving in India at the time of the Durbar celebrations. @militaryarchive", "authorname": "militaryarchive", "id": "32254785-8244754188-72157632184186282", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8244754188/#comment72157632245345688", "realname": "Benedicte  Ndoto", "path_alias": null, "author": "91057584@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1355479185", "_content": "uhhhhhh", "authorname": "bndoto", "id": "32254785-8244754188-72157632245345688", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8244754188/#comment72157632256475759", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "69679868@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1355667167", "_content": "Firmly identifying this officer may prove to be difficult.  Safe to assume that the picture is taken post-1911 as highlighted by militaryarchive above.  Also that whoever he is, he did not see service in the South African war.  The officer does have a wound stripe on his left lower sleeve, and a brigade flash on his left shoulder, though which brigade is unclear.  There are several Lt Col Evans to choose from.  He is not, however Lt Col William Evans CMG DSO RA born 1871 - as that officer would have had South Africa medals and his DSO by 1911.\n\nThere is no record in the CWGC list of a Lieutenant Colonel Evans in the Royal Field Artillery killed during the First World War, so this officer may have survived.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8244754188-72157632256475759", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8244754188"}}
