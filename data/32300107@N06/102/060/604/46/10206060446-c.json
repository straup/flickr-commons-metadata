It is possible to trace parts of his ecclesiastical career via newspapers and clerical directories.\n\nFrom the British Newspaper Archive:\n\nThe &quot;Ecclesiastical Intelligence&quot; column in the <em>Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser</em>  of 13 October 1888 records that the Rev J. W. Andrews was appointed Vicar of Trysull in 1888, previously being curate of St Leonard's, Bridgenorth.\n\nThe <em>Gloucestershire Echo</em> of 24 July 1837 reported on the Will of a Rev. John Wilson Andrews, M.A., formerly of the Douro House Nursing Home, Cheltenham, who had died on the 4 February 1937.\n\nFrom the snippets of <em>Crockford's Clerical Directory</em> available on the Web, it appears that the Rev. Andrews went to Clare College, Cambridge (BA 1877, MA 1883); was ordained deacon in 1878, priest in 1879 (Hereford Cathedral); served as curate at Hope-under-Dinsmore (Herefs), 1878-81, senior curate at St Leonard, Bridgenorth (Herefs) 1881-88, Vicar of Trysull (Lichfield) from 1888. I think that he was still in Trysull in 1930, although that could be confirmed by consulting later editions of Crockford.", "authorname": "michaelday_bath", "id": "32254785-10206060446-72157636688607133", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "10206060446"}}
