During the hot weather, \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d became luxuriant with rank grass and flowers which gave good cover to the movement of patrols and resulted in many skirmishes. During one such fight between patrols on July 8th, 2nd Lieutenant A.A.D. Baird was killed. He was a very popular young officer, son of Colonel A. Baird, R.A.M.C., for many years Medical Officer to the Depot at Norton Barracks.\n\nSource: The Worcestershire Regiment in the Great War, by Captain H. FitzM.
