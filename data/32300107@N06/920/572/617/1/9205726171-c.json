The landing and others at various points along the peninsula were designed to capture the peninsula from Turkish troops defending it under German direction, and to open the Dardanelles Straits to British warships \u2014 thus facilitating a planned naval attack on Constantinople (Istanbul). The Gallipoli campaign ended in failure and high casualties for the British side, which included numbers of Australians, New Zealanders and Newfoundlanders.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22021/22021-h/22021-h.htm#Page_54\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gutenberg.org/files/22021/22021-h/22021-h.htm#Page_54</a>               The Project Gutenberg EBook of Gallipoli Diary, Volume 2, by Ian Hamilton\n p242 5th-6th October 1915 on Suvla, mentions 2/1st Coy. of the London Regiment, 29th Division, 52nd Division, 53rd Division, 86th Brigade, 88th Brigade and 1st Newfoundland Battalion (their first day in the trenches).", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-9205726171-72157634605199029", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/9205726171/#comment72157634611758152", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1373647036", "_content": "As per IWM, HU 112910.
