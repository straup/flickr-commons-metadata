His father is recorded as a widower. Walter is not living at the premises.\nThe description of his father\u2019s employment as a tobacconist [dealer] and the style of house that they lived in leads me to the conclusion that Walter may have been sent away to school. Hence his non-appearance on the 1911 census.\n[additional information  - found later] His father re-married [Frances / Francesca Mary Aster] a Russia emigrant and accomplished pianist and they had another son Alan Paul Dickson [known as Paul] who went on to become a film director and head of direction at the National Film School.\nHis obituary is here\n<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/08/paul-dickson\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/08/paul-dickson</a>\nAs can be seen, he too, was sent away to boarding school .
