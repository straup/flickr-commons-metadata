Youngest son of John William Adamson of 44 Whitehall Park, Highgate, Professor of Education, University of London, and his [Prof Adamson\u2019s] wife, Amanda, daughter of the late William Knapman.\nBorn 28th December 1894. Educated City of London School and Merton College, Oxford. \nReceived a commission and was gazetted 2nd Lieutenant (The Middlesex Regiment) 5th March 1915 and promoted 2nd Lieutenant in April 1916. Served with the Expeditionary Force in France and Flanders  from July to August 1915, also from October 1917 and was killed in action before Croisilles  24th August 1918. Buried in Bellacourt Military Cemetery, Rivi\u00e9re near Arras.\nHis Commanding Officer wrote \u201c....He fell ... while most gallantly leading his men over an area swept by artillery and machine-gun fire.\u201d He was awarded the Military Cross [London Gazette, 16th September 1918]. \u201cFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty duringa night raid on hostile trenches... He led his party with the greatest personal courage and precision, ... and his splendid example and fine leadership contributed largely to the success of the raid.\u201d\nUnmarried.\nThe 1901 census records Gilbert as a six year old child living at 24 Countess Street, Kentish Town [the premises still exist] with his father, John W [b.1858, London, and who\u2019s occupation is given as Lecturer in Education, Kings College]. His mother, Caroline A [b.1855 London] and his two older sisters, Dorothy E [b.1889] and Cecily M [b.1891].\nI am puzzled by the De Ruvigny\u2019s entry which gives his mother\u2019s name as Amanda as does an Andrews Newspaper index card and yet his mother, in the 1901 census is recorded as Caroline A. Maybe the A stands for Amanda and this was how she as colloquially known.", "authorname": "liits", "id": "32254785-6460818341-72157628309130581", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6460818341/#comment72157628310389715", "realname": "Johnny Hodgson", "path_alias": "johnnyh", "author": "47821015@N00", "iconserver": "2440", "datecreate": "1323207038", "_content": "I have such complete and total respect and gratitude for this generation.
