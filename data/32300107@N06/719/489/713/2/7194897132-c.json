That had allowed the Germans to tunnel extensively towards the Allied lines, something the British immediately engaged with both by counter-mining and aggressive above-ground trench raids.

Salmet followed this up with a sponsored Daily Mail Tour, in 1912 where the wings of his aircraft were bore the Daily Mail name and he became known as the\u201d Daily Mail Aviator\u201d. In 1914 he turned up at Paignton during the Easter week, sporting the Daily Mail logo on his wings for a programme of demonstrations and pleasure flights, he had a series of engine problems and even had a new engine installed. Monday May 6th 1914 Salmet with his passenger called Mr Harry Van Trump of Taunton (a member of the firm Tonevale Manufacturing Co) promised to do an air display off Watchet harbour before heading to Weston Super Mare. The crowds lined the esplanade in expectation and at 3.40pm in the afternoon and he was sighted well out to sea, and then, to the consternation of the crowds, the engines stopped and the aircraft was seen to fall into the sea a mile off shore. A lifeboat was launched and fortunately the men suffered no more than an undignified dunking. Salmet brushed the incident off saying it was not the first time he had received a drenching, his unruffled passenger Harry Van Trump was heard to say, \u201cIt was a bit of an experience\u201d and declared he would fly again with Salmet at Weston.

After training Henry sailed for the Cape, South Africa and arrived March 29th 1900 \nThe Boers were tough men, expert horsemen and marksmen and were a disciplined and capable enemy. They engaged in hard-fought guerrilla warfare against the British forces. This lasted a further eighteen months during which the Boers raided targets such as British columns, telegraph sites, railways and storage depots. \n\nIn an effort to cut off supplies to the raiders, the British, now under the control of Lord Kitchener, responded with a scorched earth policy of destroying Boer farms and by moving civilians into concentration camps.  The plight of the Boer women and children in these camps became an international outrage - more than 20,000 died in the carelessly run, unhygienic camps.\n\nIn addition to battles and skirmishes under the South African sun, the troops also endured a poorly run campaign, where they often did not get enough supplies including food to eat or clean drinking water \nwhich is evidenced by the typhoid /enteric fever epidemic which killed as many as 50 per day at one stage.\n\nBy the time a treaty was signed in May 1902 the last of the imperial wars had claimed, 22,000 British, 12,000 African lives and 25,000 Afrikaners most in concentration camps.\n\nAlthough the two Republics were now absorbed into the British Empire, the granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.\n\nHenry would have returned about Oct 1902 having been away for nearly 3 years, and now aged 22yrs and would be a tough individual having survived many hardships, certainly an expert rider and excellent rifle shot.

In all cases however the name was derived from the fact that shells fired from light or field artillery travelled faster than the speed of sound.\n\nThus soldiers heard the typical &quot;whizz&quot; noise of a travelling shell before the &quot;bang&quot; issued by the gun itself.  Whizz bangs consequently much feared since the net result was that defending infantrymen were given virtually no warning of incoming high-velocity artillery fire as they were from enemy howitzers.\n\n7.7cm FK 96\nThe 7.7cm (3.1&quot;) Field Gun was the 'whizz bang' of so many WW1 Memoirs.
