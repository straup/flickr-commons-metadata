He was appointed to an Active Service appointment with the Royal Irish Fusiliers with 8 other Second Lieutenants with effect 20 Jan 1916.\n\nA full account of the attack by 9th Royal Irish Fusiliers on 1st July 1916 may be found at <a href=\"http://www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=77\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=77</a>  Suffice to say that 9 RIF went over the top of their parapet in four waves between 07.10hrs and 07.30hrs to get into a feature in no-mans-land called the Ravine, within 150 yards of the German line, before the artillery lifted at 07.30hrs (Zero).  However the German machine-gunners had located the gaps cut in the wire through which the Fusiliers had to approach their objectives.  Of 33 officers and just over 600 other ranks of 9 RIF who attacked, 215 All Ranks were Killed or posted Missing and 303 were Wounded.  2Lt Alexander Seggie was one of the Missing - his remains were only later recovered from the battlefield.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7194897388-72157630234574414", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7194897388/#comment72157631751501042", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1350044443", "_content": "His birth was registered in Dublin North in the Jul-Sep Quarter of 1892.", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-7194897388-72157631751501042", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7194897388"}}
