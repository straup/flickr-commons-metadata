This battalion is confirmed on L/Cpl Adam's entry in Soldiers Died in The Great War. \n\nLance-Corporal Adams' original number with the 5th Londons was 521 and he joined the battalion in the first week of September 1914.  Aftre the action on 1st July 1916 he was presumably posted as missing in action and wouldn have still officially been noted as missing in 1917 when the Territorial Force was re-numbered.  This explains why he was given a new number in early 1917, even though he had, by that time, been dead for five or six months.  \n\nFor regimental number information about the 5th Londons see: <a href=\"http://armyservicenumbers.blogspot.com/2008/08/5th-city-of-london-bn-london-rifle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">armyservicenumbers.blogspot.com/2008/08/5th-city-of-londo...</a>", "authorname": "Paul C A Nixon", "id": "32254785-6265792047-72157628001366021", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6265792047/#comment72157628136182600", "realname": "Steve Smith", "path_alias": null, "author": "69798423@N03", "iconserver": "8322", "datecreate": "1321389787", "_content": "SDGW Info:\n\nName: Douglas George Adams\nResidence: Herne Hill\nDeath Date: 1 Jul 1916\nDeath Location: France &amp; Flanders \nEnlistment Location: London\nRank: L/Corporal\nRegiment: London Regiment\nBattalion: 5th (City of London) Battalion (London Rifle Brigade)\nNumber: 300432\nType of Casualty: Killed in action\nTheatre of War: Western European Theatre", "authorname": "Steve Smith 1944", "id": "32254785-6265792047-72157628136182600", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6265792047/#comment72157631765552692", "realname": "Denise Jackson", "path_alias": "mrs_audubon", "author": "64288588@N05", "iconserver": "3003", "datecreate": "1350209920", "_content": "In 1901 the Adamses lived at 39 Bartholomew Road, St Pancras <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=511&amp;wrapid=tlif135020996500810&amp;q=39+holmdene+avenue,+herne+hill,+camberwell&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x48760475a4f831d5:0xb24f9b849cbd3bfa,39+Holmdene+Ave,+London+SE24+9LB,+UK&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wJF6UPa5Coek0QXtmoCICQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf...</a>  Mr Adams had his own Grocer's business. \nIn 1911 the family were living at 39 Holmdene Avenue, Herne Hill, London <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=511&amp;wrapid=tlif135020996500810&amp;q=39+holmdene+avenue,+herne+hill,+camberwell&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x48760475a4f831d5:0xb24f9b849cbd3bfa,39+Holmdene+Ave,+London+SE24+9LB,+UK&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wJF6UPa5Coek0QXtmoCICQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf...</a> and Douglas was a 15yr old schoolboy.
