Is it possible that this is actually the man depicted in the photograph? - not being an army expert by any stretch of the imagination, I did some research:\n \u201cIn February 1915, with the general introduction of warrant officers throughout the army, Conductors and Sub Conductors became Warrant Officers Class I.\u201d (Wikipedia)\n\nAs regards insignia \u201cfrom 11 July 1900, Conductors were authorised to wear a crown within a laurel wreath on their lower sleeve and Sub-Conductors a crown, although they did not start actually wearing these until 1901 and 1904 respectively. In 1915, Conductors were authorised a crown in a laurel wreath and Sub-Conductors the royal coat of arms. In 1918, Conductors began wearing the royal arms in a laurel wreath, still their badge of rank.\u201d (Wikipedia)\n\nThe man shown in the photograph appears to have this insignia on the badge on his cap \u2013 you can\u2019t see the lower sleeves.\n\nI\u2019ve also discovered that there is a listing for a \u2018William Bayes\u2019 on the Woking Memorial to World War One in the Town Square but no rank is listed against the listing.\n\nNot sure if this helps at all but thought I should post these facts with nothing seemingly known about this brave man.", "authorname": "M2901", "id": "32254785-6265792059-72157627993202773", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6265792059/#comment72157628127199322", "realname": "", "path_alias": "coolshanagh55", "author": "69645150@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1321290172", "_content": "I wonder if this was actually H H W Boyes who served in the Royal Engineers.
