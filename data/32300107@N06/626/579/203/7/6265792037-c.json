The combined party, leading the advance against the enemy\u2019s left worked their way round through the bush until, about 11 a.m., when they were checked by heavy rifle and machine gun fire from well-constructed trenches on the German flank. Here they held their ground for about five hours, until Lieutenant Thompson judged that the enemy\u2019s fire was slackening as a result of the British [and French] response, whereupon, he led his men in an assault well supported by Captain Caistaing with the remainder of the Senegalese. But the enemy machine guns had not been greatly affected; and in spite of the great gallantry they displayed, the attackers were brought to a standstill fifty yards from the enemy trenches.\n\nLieutenant Thompson, Lieutenant Guillmart and many African other\nranks were killed and wounded. The seventeen Senegalese soldiers\nallocated to Lieutenant Thompson were all killed or wounded except one.\nThe positions of the bodies of the twelve Senegalese showed that they had stood faithfully by the young British officer whose safety they believed had been entrusted to their care.
