At that time they lived at 207 Allerton Road, Bradford. Richard's older brother Thomas F Owen had been born in Bradford circa 1880 and his parents married there so perhaps there were family conections.\n\nNor was Mr Owen at home at the time of the 1911 census. Georgina was described as Traveller (Provisions, etc.), in other words a Travelling Sales Woman, which is quite an unusual occupation for a woman. Thomas Frederick Owen was a Railway Clerk and Richard Henry Stanley, at the age of 17, was a Shop Assistant at Oldham Equitable Co-Operative Society. (The building is Grade II listed and currently occupied by Carpet World on Huddersfield Road <a href=\"http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-388905-oldham-equitable-co-operative-society-bu/bingmap\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-388905-oldham-equitab...</a>). Perhaps because Georgina was away from home a lot, the family employed a House Keeper, 36yr old Annie Roberts. They occupied 5 rooms at 10 Bridson Street, Clarksfield, Oldham, Lancashire. \n\nBridson Street still stands and is a row of red-brick two-bedroomed terrace houses. Richard and his brother likely occupied one bedroom whilst Georgina and Annie shared the other. <a href=\"http://www.belvoirlettings.com/bridson-street-clarksfield-oldham/60406\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.belvoirlettings.com/bridson-street-clarksfield-oldham...</a>\n\nThere is a family tree for the Owens on <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ancestry.co.uk</a> with photographs of Georgina (nee Wicks) who died in 1947, along with others of Richard in uniform and with his brother when they were young. In my opinion the two photographs of Richard do not tally.\n\nThe tree shows that Mr Owen was born in 1866 in Shifnal, Shropshire but gives no date of death. In 1891 the family was living at 9 Heywood Street, Congleton, Cheshire and Thomas Owen was described as an Evangelist. So, perhaps his was also an itinerant profession which saw the family moving from place to place as he sought to convert people.", "authorname": "Mrs Audubon", "id": "32254785-6260268807-72157631764429533", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6260268807"}}
