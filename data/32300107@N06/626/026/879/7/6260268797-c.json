That's an important question with a complex answer. Of course we would advise you to check the terms of the fee paying service. In general, copyright lapses 70 yrs after the death of the author. And 'crown copyright' for government publications lapses 50 years after publication. So most of the relevant material is out of copyright. However, digitised images of, for example, census records and military records will be subject to other license restrictions. In general, you are <b>not allowed to post these images</b> on Flickr (or elsewhere) but you can share the  <b>information</b> you read from them. I hope that makes sense -- I'm sure we'll be revisiting and further clarifying this point over the coming weeks. \n\nMany thanks.", "authorname": "IWM Collections", "id": "32254785-6260268797-72157628112156942", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6260268797/#comment72157627992251629", "realname": "", "path_alias": "coolshanagh55", "author": "69645150@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1321188741", "_content": "Percy Gordon S Oliver - a driver in the French Red Cross.\nBorn in 1899 at Bollington, Cheshire, son of Edmund and his wife Florence.\nHe married Kathleen J Parsons at St George, Hanover Square in 1923.", "authorname": "Coolshanagh25", "id": "32254785-6260268797-72157627992251629", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6260268797/#comment72157628118742926", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "16830149@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1321202239", "_content": "Thanks for the clarification.\nTaken from <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.familysearch.org</a>\nName: Percy Gordon Stanley Oliver  \nRecord Place: Prestbury, Wellington Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Bollington, Cheshire  \nBirth: 10 Oct 1889 Baptism Date: 29 Oct 1899     \nFather's Name: Edmund Lomas Oliver  \nMother's Name: Florence Adelaide Oliver       \nPage Number: 57  \nImage Number: 00825  \nFilm Number: 2299418  \nDigital Folder Number: 4020669", "authorname": "shayes2006", "id": "32254785-6260268797-72157628118742926", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6260268797/#comment72157628360141329", "realname": "Christian L\u00fcts", "path_alias": "liits", "author": "63191264@N00", "iconserver": "2156", "datecreate": "1323536576", "_content": "Born in 1899 the 1901 census records him, one year old, the [then] youngest child of- as previously stated, Edmund Lomas Oliver [b.1866 Bollington Cheshire d. 26/7/1953] and Florence Adelaide Oliver [b.1871, Leeds, West Yorks. d.29/10/1956].He is living at Wellington Road, Bollinton with his older sisters Rosina Muriel [b. 1896 d.1994], Kathleen Mary [b.1898 d.1945] and older brother [Ian]Maurice Lomas.
