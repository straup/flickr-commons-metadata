Towards the evening of that day, High Wood came into the reckoning. An attack was originally scheduled for 5.15pm, although in the event it was delayed first until 6.15pm and then a little later. The 2nd Queens reached the south western edge of the wood around 8pm, and shortly afterwards they were joined by the 1st South Staffordshires.  The British found that they could not take a strongly prepared German position known as the Switch Line which ran through the remains of the northern apex of the wood.  With around two-thirds of High Wood now captured, reinforcements were sent up, including men from the 1/9 Highland Light Infantry (Glasgow Highlanders). (100th Bde, 33rd Div)\nAt midnight on the 14th of July, the Germans counterattacked.  Twenty-four hours after the initial dawn attack, fighting continued in High Wood, and except for the north-eastern corner the Germans held it again.   The capture of High Wood was essential for further British attacks planned on the 15th of July, and by daylight further troops were thrown in, including the 16th Kings Royal Rifle Corps and the 2nd Worcesters. The fighting continued, but by evening on the 15th the Germans were still in control of High Wood, and were to remain so for a further two months.\nAt the edge of High Wood today is a memorial to men of the 1/9 Highland Light Infantry (Glasgow Highlanders), which is relatively recent. Constructed in 1972, it comprises a cairn with 192 stones taken from another High Wood (near Culloden), commemorating the 192 soldiers of the Glasgow Highlanders who were killed here. The height of the cairn, five feet and seven inches, also represents the minimum height accepted for recruits iunto the battalion.&quot;\n\nThese events may also connect with 2Lt C H Dickerson, 11th A&amp;SH, another officer depicted in this portfolio of iwm photographs.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6260268789-72157628111199205", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6260268789/#comment72157628257044791", "realname": "Scottish Military Research Group", "path_alias": "smrg", "author": "69139286@N07", "iconserver": "6109", "datecreate": "1322900448", "_content": "Listed on the Prestwick War Memorial.
