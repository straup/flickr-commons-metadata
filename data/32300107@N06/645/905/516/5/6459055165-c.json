Cedric was born in Wolverhampton, and his siblings were born in Preston. Ida was one year and Wilson was four years younger than Cedric; Briadley was a year younger than Wilson and Ruth was two years younger than Briadley. (In 1901 Census - 9, 8, 5, 4, 2 respectively.) Presumably Wilson and Briadley were the two younger brothers who enlisted in the Royal Engineers.  It is not known if this was the complete family or if there were children after Ruth. In the household at 3 West View were a cook/domestic, Annie Franklin from Wexford; and a 15-year old housemaid, Emily Eastham, born in Preston.\n\nSource: Preston Grammar School article (above AndyBailey)\nFound dead in bed on Wednesday morning, a retired Naval captain, Mr Cedric Naylor, of \u201cRedholme\u201d, London Road.\nDied of a coronary thrombosis in Deal, Kent, on January 12, 1949 age 57.
