His Regimental number was 5457 and he is photographed wearing a 1914 pattern cap, both of which suggest that he enlisted in The Queen Victoria's Rifles 'under age' in the summer of 1915 (August or September) - aged 16 or 17.  This also means that he was on active service overseas well before the regulation age of 19, (in 1916, when reported missing, he would have been 18 at most).//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6877430564-72157629799823899", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6877430564/#comment72157629934564932", "realname": "Mary Nung", "path_alias": "deadt44", "author": "30886974@N00", "iconserver": "8117", "datecreate": "1338214572", "_content": "Such a young looking lad.
