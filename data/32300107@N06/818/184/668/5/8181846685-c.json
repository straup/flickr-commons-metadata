The 1/5th, which had been reported as attached to the 36th Division, was holding Schwaben Redoubt, but only a small party of officers (including Lieut. Col. Wood) and men were in the stronghold; the remainder of the battalion was at Johnstone's Post. Throughout the 2nd, the 36th Division claimed the services of the companies at Johnstone's Post, so that all day the 1/5th Battalion may be said to have been engaged in carrying parties for the Ulstermen. Shell fire was again heavy and the 1/5th lost Major F.C.Thompson (missing) and three officers killed (including the Adjutant, Lieut. Canbourne), three officers wounded and three other ranks killed and fifty wounded.", "authorname": "John Willy", "id": "32254785-8181846685-72157632121349287", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8181846685"}}
