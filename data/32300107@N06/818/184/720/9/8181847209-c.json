The 1st and 1/8th battalions reached the German front-line trenches and entered the village. Their situation quickly deteriorated in the face of immediate counter-attacks, and the 1/8th's support battalion was driven back by Germans who re-gained and continued to occupy the first-line trenches.  Isolated and contained by counter-attacks, the 1/8th and three companies of the 1st found themselves outflanked and surrounded.  The 1/8th had been annihilated with 15 killed, 55 wounded, and 502 missing, while the 1st Battalion lost its commanding officer, Colonel Goff, and sustained 239 casualties, many were captured having fought-on for 36 hours and expended their ammunition.  The 1st later received a draft of 20 officers and 750 men from the Manchester Regiment.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-8181847209-72157632025652732", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8181847209"}}
