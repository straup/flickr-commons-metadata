The explosion apparently caused panic amongst the crew of 20. The engines were not stopped and this caused problems with launching the boats. The master fell into a lowered boat that immediately capsized drowning 10 men. Some of the crew succeeded in launching another boat and the rest had to jump over the side to swim to it.\n\nExposure in the icy December water accounted for the loss of another 2 of the crew bringing the number lost to 12. The survivors were picked up by a fishing boat and landed at Whitby. The ship sank in 14 minutes and it was considered later that if the crew had kept calm, it is likely that they would all have been saved.\n\nSource:  Racey, Carl.
