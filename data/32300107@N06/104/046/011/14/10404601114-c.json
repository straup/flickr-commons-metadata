By early that year the covers of German shipyards had accumulated. Brachi was able to learn, step by step, the methods and pace of each shipyard. He would assign a new code number to every submarine as soon as its keel was laid and then monitor its progress in each subsequent photograph. The first report he prepared based on this study of successive aerial photographs set a precedent for the remainder of the war, for the report did simply inform the reader of what could be seen in the photographs but it estimated future U-boat production. \n\nFrom his examinations of the photographs Brachi knew that the 500-ton U-boats were normally off the slips after eight months. Since fitting out the boats required another two to three months, he could add a submarine to his production estimate for eleven months ahead as soon as he saw a new keel laid down. Even German camouflage did not prevent such estimates, for the extent of camouflage was precisely related to the stage of construction.\n\nThe estimate Brachi produced was a shocker - a doubled production of U-boats in four months, ten in March, twenty in July. As a result, a new Admiralty estimate of U-boat production was produced, relying almost entirely on Brachi's data. Once completed it was submitted immediately to Admiral John Godrey, Director of Naval Intelligence. The next day the subject was raised at a meeting of the chiefs of staff, after which the production estimate went to Churchill. It was very shortly after this, on the 6th March 1941, that Churchill's Battle of the Atlantic directive called for Britain  &quot;...to take the offensive against the U-boat...wherever we can and whenever we can. The U-boat at sea must be hunted, the U-boat in the building yard or in dock, must be bombed&quot; </i>\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HohPaIyc5G0C&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=David+Brachi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5gdMU6JsuC&amp;sig=MBfdvkZm0Rj-DEjJ2WMODRVdQvA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pFNoUrGBDfLX7Abf7IEI&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=David Brachi&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.co.uk/books?id=HohPaIyc5G0C&amp;pg=PA162&amp;amp...</a>\n\nThe gems keep turning up for this family.
