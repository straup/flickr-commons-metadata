At the end of June the ground in front of the firing trench was reconnoitred by patrols, while the rest of the Battalion rehearsed behind the lines the method of attack. Night work in &quot;No Man\u2019s Land&quot; was hampered by bright moonlight, and there were several casualties among the wire. The trenches were also subjected to a heavy shell fire. In spite of these obstacles 2nd Lieut. Turner carried out successful reconnaissances in broad daylight as far as the enemy\u2019s lines, and obtained very valuable information. For this he eventually received the Military Cross.\nSo the excitement intensified until it came to a head on July 22nd, when the Battalion received orders to take part in an attack by the 13th brigade in the neighbourhood of Longueval, Delville Wood and High Wood. Here they occupied trenches recently captured from the Germans, and their orders were to make a further push, the 15th Battalion being in reserve. A and B Companies went over the top at 10 p.m., advancing in two waves. As the companies began to extend from sections in file formation the enemy opened an overwhelming machine-gun and rifle volley. The inevitable result was that the two companies suffered heavily, and although supports were thrown in, they received the same treatment. Then there was nothing for it but to fall back to the jumping-off ground and organise the original front line trench to meet a possible counter-attack. This was successfully done, and it was generally agreed that no more could have been achieved. Their neighbours of the West Kent Regiment and the Scottish Borderers were equally unfortunate.\nThis bitter day\u2019s work cost the Battalion very heavy casualties in killed, missing and wounded. The officers killed were Lieut. R. S . Payton (in charge of the Lewis guns), 2nd Lieuts. J. W. Lygoe, H. L. Greenwood and H. L. Hodes. Those reported as missing but believed to have been killed included Capt. H. S. Matthews, a member of a well-known Birmingham family, 2nd Lieuts. S. H. R. Hewitt and R. Whitbread.</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.birminghampals.co.uk/bookofhonour/14th.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.birminghampals.co.uk/bookofhonour/14th.htm</a>\n\n<i>22nd and 23rd July 1916\nAfter the 20th July attacks limped to their conclusions, the Germans reoccupied most of High Wood, until only the southern corner remained in British hands. They also dug a new defensive position, known as Intermediate trench, ahead of the Switch Line to the west of the wood. This meant that taking the wood, already almost within British hands twice only to slip away, became an even tougher proposition.\nEfforts however continued, and on the night of the 22nd/23rd of July, the 4th Gordon Highlanders attacked the eastern corner of the wood, whilst the 1st Royal West Kents attacked the south-eastern part of the wood and Wood Lane, there with the 14th Royal Warwickshires at their side. \nThere had been a preliminary bombardment, but this had not inflicted sufficient loss on the defenders, and they were able to hold High Wood. No significant gains were made, although the Royal West Kents suffered 420 casualties. The other battalions also suffered losses.</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/high_wood.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/high_wood.html</a>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-10404602444-72157636912719845", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "10404602444"}}
