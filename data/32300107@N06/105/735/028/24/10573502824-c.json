In addition 6th Bn, King\u2019s Own Scottish Borderers, 11th and 12th Bns, Royal Scots of 27 Bde were in reserve. \n\nThe Black Watch took Adler farm and then moved on to the Green Line. Parties moved forward and into Source Trench. By this time the Camerons, Seaforths and even some Royal Scots had become intermixed. They moved through the Black Watch and into Wallemollen. Driven back they formed a line from Inch House to the Cemetery. On the left flank the Argylls lost the barrage, wandered into 18th Div area and were stopped by MG fire from Meunier House and Beek House. The KOSB and Royal Scots brought forward from reserve were stopped by a pillbox and dug in. All in all an advance of 100 yards had been achieved. \n<a href=\"http://forum.irishmilitaryonline.com/showthread.php?11535-The-Battle-of-Passchendaele/page5\" rel=\"nofollow\">forum.irishmilitaryonline.com/showthread.php?11535-The-Ba...</a>\n\nFor a flavour of some of the action on the day, there is this on an officer of the 8th Battalion Black Watch who died in the same part of the battlefield.\n\n<i>2nd Lieutenant (Temporary Lieutenant) Alexander Simpson HARPER, joined the\n8th (Service) Battalion, Black Watch on 15th August 1916.\n\nOn 12th October 1917 the Battalion was involved in the attack at\nPasschendaele. A &amp; B Companies were at Canopus Trench, C &amp; D at California\nDrive, and Battalion HQ at Cheddar Villa. Shortly after the commencement of\nthe attack, D Company (Temp. Lt. HARPER) came under severe enfilade machine\ngun and rifle from the direction of Oxford Houses. The Company advanced on\nthe left of C Company and had been drawn into the fight earlier than\nintended. Lt. HARPER, who was in command, went forward with one section and\nCompany HQ with the object of capturing a pill box, from which the Company\nwas being enfiladed. Of this party, all became casualties except the\nSergeant-Major. Lt. HARPER was killed in his gallant attempt. The enemy,\noffered a most determined resistance here and were about 100 strong, the\nassumption being that they had sheltered in the pill box during the barrage\npreceding the attack. The terrain encountered during the attack is\ndescribed as a sea of mud with shell-holes half filled with water.</i>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GREATWAR/2002-10/1035475922\" rel=\"nofollow\">archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GREATWAR/2002-10/1...</a></i>", "authorname": "Moominpappa06", "id": "32254785-10573502824-72157637210158963", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/10573502824/#comment72157637314138916", "realname": "Michael Day", "path_alias": null, "author": "13706945@N00", "iconserver": "3710", "datecreate": "1383592843", "_content": "Lieutenant Boulton also features in the Camerons' regimental history.\n\n<em>Historical Records of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders</em>, Vol. IV (Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1931).\n\nThe parts on the 5th Battalion were mostly written by Captain J.
