His birthplace is now given as Victoria, Australia.\n\nFrom a biography on Julian Rossi Ashton, there is this on Cecil's father, George Rossi.\n\n<i>His brother George Rossi (b.1857) studied at the South Kensington School of Art and became a black-and-white illustrator for the London Graphic. In 1877-78 he represented the Illustrated London News at the Kaffir war and next year joined Julian on the Illustrated Australian News in Melbourne; together they covered the capture of the Kelly gang at Glenrowan. He was among the first sketch-artists of the Bulletin, drew also for the Australasian Sketcher, the Illustrated Sydney News and the Picturesque Atlas of Australasia, and was art editor and artist for Victoria and its Metropolis. In 1886-88 he was a member of the Art Society of New South Wales and the Australian Artists' Association (Victoria). In 1893 he returned to England where he continued to illustrate for various papers and toured music-halls with a lightning-sketch routine. He published Australasian Sketches (London, 1895). He had married Blanche Brooke, daughter of George Coppin, and settled on the River Dart with his wife and two sons.</i>\n<a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ashton-julian-rossi-5073\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ashton-julian-rossi-5073</a>\n\nThere is a Gerald Rossi Ashton whose name appears on the list of newly commissioned officers published in the London Gazette on the 2nd March 1915, effective 31st December 1914.\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29086/pages/2115/page.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29086/pages/2115/page.pdf</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30199/pages/7488/page.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30199/pages/7488/page.pdf</a>\n\nHowever there is no obvious Medal Index Card for him - the nearest is a Temporary Second Lieutenant C G Rossi-Ashton, who served with the South Lancashire Regiment.\n\nIts in the London Gazette of the 19th June 1917 we get a possible explanation for the absense of a Medal Index Card.

It also puts Cecil George's birth year as 1900, which doesn't fit with what the CWGC database says (although Gibson and Miles note that Ashton's service record is untidy and almost illegible). \n\nTo summarise, the entry in the book records that the Kingswear Cecil George Ashton was the son of George Rossi Ashton, a famous artist and illustrator. It claims that, according to his service record, Cecil George was born in 1900 (in Australia) and by 1918 had joined the Australian RNVR, and had been accepted for the Royal Flying Corps. By May 1918, he was a Lieutenant, a Temporary Captain in administration. By 16th June 1918 he was stationed at Strathbeg, an airship base. He was later based at Malahide and Llangefni (North Wales), with short postings to London and Wexford, before being posted to Pembroke (also an airship base) in December. On the 1st January 1919, he was sent to a dispersal centre at Crystal Palace. On the 21st January 1919, he was placed on the unemployed list, but remained in the RAF. On the 24th February, he died of influenza and pneumonia at 22 St. John's Wood Park, [London].\n\nThe entry finally cites an entry in <em>The Times</em>:\n\n<em>Death - On Active Service - In loving memory of Capt.
