This search resulted, on October 30th, in the Koenigsberg being discovered by HMS Chatham (Captain Sidney R Drury-Lowe) hiding in shoal water about six miles up the Rufigi River, opposite Mafia Island. Owing to her greater draught the Chatham could not reach the Koenigsberg which is probably aground except at high water.\n\nPart of the crew of the Koenigsberg is landed and entrenched on the banks of the river. Both the entrenchments and the Koenigsberg have been bombarded by the Chatham, but owing to the dense palm groves amid which the ship lies, it is not possible to estimate the damage.\n\nPending operations for her capture or destruction, effective steps have been taken to block the Koenigsberg in by sinking colliers in the only navigable channel, and she is now imprisoned and unable to do any further harm. The fast vessels which had been searching for her are thus released for other service.&quot;\n\nTaken from Army &amp; Navy Illustrated paper in 1914.", "authorname": "MaryMcnz", "id": "32254785-8157428936-72157631963179474", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/8157428936/#comment72157631972499703", "realname": "grahamH", "path_alias": "grahamh_pix", "author": "11299198@N07", "iconserver": "2112", "datecreate": "1352544194", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/89831682@N07] This sounds like a reconstruction / documentary I saw on TV some years ago.", "authorname": "grahamH", "id": "32254785-8157428936-72157631972499703", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8157428936"}}
