Over a million shells were fired by the Germans in the first 5 hours of this attack, chiefly targeting British artillery batteries which had been accurately located by aerial reconnaissance and had been static for too long on what was considered a quiet sector of the front.\n\nThe 178th Brigade war diaries June 1916 to March 1919 are at the National Archive, WO95/2598.
