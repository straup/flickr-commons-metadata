This officer is in Royal Engineers uniform and quite clearly wears the medal ribbon of the Military Cross.  Furthermore A H James served as a Lieutenant in the 11th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa from 1 Apr 1901 to 10 Apr 1902. The officer in this photograph looks to be a younger (certainly not 36+) and a less 'seasoned' soldier. He is not wearing a campaign ribbon for South African Service.  Please would you double check that the photograph is correctly indexed / attributed?  There are several indications that this is not Lt Col A H James DSO NF.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7180005363-72157630121313334", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7180005363"}}
