He went out to India to the 2nd Battalion The King's Own at Nasirabad and was a Subaltern there in Headquarters Company in 1894 and 1895.  It is evident from his campaign ribbons that he subsequently served in South Africa during the Boer Wars as he has both the Queen's South Africa War Medal 1899-1900 and King's South Africa War Medal 1901.\n\nHis National Archive Medal Index Card reveals that he went to France immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, arriving in theatre with the BEF on 20 Aug 1914, though his unit at that time is not shown.  He received the 1914 (Mons) Star, Victory Medal and British War Medal in 1920.  He is recorded as a Major commanding 6th Reserve Park Army Service Corps (a Horse Transport Company).  And later as a Lieutenant Colonel as Commanding Officer of Royal Army Service Corps Sussex District.\n\nHe was in fact awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 4 Jun 1917.  [Supplement to LG 5469].  This photograph was probably taken soon after he received the award, when he would have been aged 45.\n\nHe was married to Gertrude Jane Evans - but they divorced in 1920 (the co-respondent was a Charles Butler).//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-7180005443-72157630220004698", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/7180005443/#comment72157637376037255", "realname": "Lottie Smith", "path_alias": null, "author": "107834786@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1383744024", "_content": "he was my 2nd great grand uncle!", "authorname": "lottiers", "id": "32254785-7180005443-72157637376037255", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7180005443"}}
