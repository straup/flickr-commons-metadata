My father also served in WWI, as an officer in the Ghurkha regiment. He died in 1943 when my brother and I were 6 and 4 respectively. His sister Juliet came to live with us in London, and helped raise us while my mother was working. Aunt Juliet often used to talk to us about Will. She was educated at Oxford and published a small book of poems, one of them to Will. The last lines read: </i>Ten years old is a boy today; What is he like? You say True heart and happy heart, joyous and loving. <i>As the only daughter in her family with six younger brothers Juliet helped bring them up, and I don't think she ever got over the loss.\nThank you Imperial War Museum for creating the WWI centenary project honoring these brave young soldiers who gave their lives so bravely and selflessly.
