It is almost certainly a black mourning armband. He would in all likelihood have attended his father's funeral in uniform. Given his rank and distinguished service it would probably have been a Regimental funeral, or a family funeral at Kelston Park in Somerset and a Regimental memorial service.\n\nIt would be reasonable to further speculate that the photograph was taken during whatever pre-embarkation leave the Battalion officers might have been allowed. The date might be further narrowed to perhaps between the declaration of war on Tuesday 4th August and Lt Jones reporting back for duty at Chelsea Barracks when 1st Battalion Scots Guards mustered to entrain for Southampton, perhaps Monday 10th August. A military family would have had no illusions as to the gravity of events and this, as are most of the later portraits in the portfolio, is undoubtedly a 'keepsake' photograph for his mother to remember him by. Company Subalterns would have been very busy and he may only have had the briefest opportunity to say goodbye to his family.//", "authorname": "Gary Donaldson", "id": "32254785-6641627883-72157628994349043", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6641627883/#comment72157636745549394", "realname": "Michael Wackers", "path_alias": null, "author": "100131781@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1382254802", "_content": "Scots guards, not grenadiers!", "authorname": "MikeTheFritz", "id": "32254785-6641627883-72157636745549394", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6641627883"}}
