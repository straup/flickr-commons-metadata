The Persia sank in five to ten minutes, killing 343 of the 519 aboard. The sinking was highly controversial, since it broke naval international law, or the &quot;Cruiser Rules&quot;, that stated merchant shipping carrying passengers should be given opportunity for the passengers to disembark before combat could commence. A warning shot across the bow should have been given first. Instead, the U-Boat fired a torpedo with no warning.&quot;  \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Persia_%281900%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Persia_%281900%29</a>", "authorname": "brenontario", "id": "32254785-6641627877-72157628947935521", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6641627877/#comment72157628948516777", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62508825@N00", "iconserver": "7026", "datecreate": "1327032688", "_content": "In 1881 Census, Aldred (sic) R Nethersole age 13, Frederick E (sic) Nethersole age 15 and Percy R.
