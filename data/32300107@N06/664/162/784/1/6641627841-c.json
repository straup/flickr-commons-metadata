Harold was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1898 but when, on 5th August 1906 at All Saints Knightsbridge, he married my mother Sibyl (and not Eliza Catherine Edwards mentioned by brenontario above) he automatically became a member of the landed gentry.  As such he did not need to have paid employment and in 1909 he retired from the army.  However, his retirement did not last long as he rejoined in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War.\n\nHis subsequent life is summarised in this extract from the report of his funeral in the Bedfordshire Times and Standard of 3rd August 1945:- \n \u201c Serving in the last Great War, he landed at Le Havre in 1914 with the Fourth Division and was in subsequent engagements at Le Cateau, Mons, Marne, Soissons, Aisne, Hill 60, Passchendaele, La Bassee, Armenti\u00e8res, Ypres, Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Loos, Somme, Bazentine, and Delville Wood.  As the result of enemy bombardments, he suffered severe shell-shock, and was invalided out of the Service in 1918.\nPrior to the present war he was a member of the Special Constabulary, later joining the Royal Observer Corps, from which he was invalided out in 1944.  His principal interests were shooting, hunting (being a member of the Oakley Hunt), gun dogs, tropical fish and wireless.\nMajor Doyne-Ditmas leaves a wife, who was before her marriage Miss Sibyl Harriet Monoux Payne, and is a daughter of Sir Philip Monoux Payne, of Wootton House, Wootton and has seven children \u2013 three sons and four daughters\u2026\u201d\n\nNow he has well over 100 direct descendants.", "authorname": "hal.dd", "id": "32254785-6641627841-72157629436172626", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/imperialwarmuseum/6641627841/#comment72157629441892516", "realname": "IWM Collections", "path_alias": "imperialwarmuseum", "author": "32300107@N06", "iconserver": "5535", "datecreate": "1334312267", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/79004301@N06] Thank you very much for adding all this information about your father and his war service.", "authorname": "IWM Collections", "id": "32254785-6641627841-72157629441892516", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6641627841"}}
