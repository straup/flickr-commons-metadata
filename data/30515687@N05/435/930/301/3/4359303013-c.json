Roosevelt and V.P. Fairbanks likeness.  I found a record of one such ribbon in a Antiques and Collectables Book, but so far have been unable to find any other record of the same ribbon... I have also looked through Cornell's Library 1904 Items. Can you give me any info on how common a find this ribbon is or where I may be able to find such info...\nThank you,\nKK", "authorname": "Creation_Captured", "id": "30510347-4359303013-72157626116462733", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4359303013"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681624}
