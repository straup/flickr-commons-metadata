The Go-game board is a wooden square which has 361 intersections formed by 19 vertical and 19 horizontal lines. Each player is given either white or black round flat stones and is free to place in turn one stone at any point of intersections. Placing the stone continues until the game is over. The player with the black stones usually starts. The players try to conquer territories by enclosing vacant points by enclosing them with their own stones. Single stone or many stones of the opponent can be captured and removed from the board by completely surrounding them with your stones. A player's final score is determined by the number of territorial points he/she made, minus the number of his/her stones captured by the opponent. The player who has a higher score wins the game. Note that some of the women playing this game here are smoking cigarettes.
