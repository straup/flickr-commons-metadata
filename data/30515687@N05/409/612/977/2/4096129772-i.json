Thousands of feet of timber which Korean lumbermen have whip-sawed out by hand. Americans Leigh S.J. Hunt and J. Sloat Fasset formed Oriental Consolidated Mining Company and bought Korean Mining and Development Company in May 18, 1898. The Oriental Consolidated Mining Company owned 10 gold pits in Unsan, Pyongan-pukto. Mail bong is one of the pits in Unsan gold mine. Unsan was a small village with a few households, but it became a differently cultured place from the mining business by Americans. Between 1903 and 1938 the annual profit from the gold mining reached more than $12,000,000, but the backward Korean Royal government sold the Korean Mining and Development Company for only $100, 000. If the Korean government didn't sell the mining ownership for a lump-sum payment, it could get $3,000,000. The mining by the Americans was continued until they were forced to relinquish it by the Japanese ruler in 1939. Source: Yi, Pae-yong. Ku Hanmal kwangsan ikwon kwa yolgang, 1984.
