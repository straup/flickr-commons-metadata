This western style attire was begun in 1895 by King Kojong's order. The headwear cannot be traced to any particular (imported) tradition. 'Kojong' ruled from 1864-1907. In late 1895, he and the crown prince, 'Sunjong', fled to the Russian legation after the assasination of Queen Min by the Japanese forces present in Korea. Upon his return in early 1897, 'Kojong' proclaimed the independent 'Great Han Empire' and thus he became Emperor of Korea. Kojong's opposition to the Protectorate treaty was well known as an imperial letter, which condemned the treaty and appealed for intervention from the Hague, was published in the popular Korea Daily News (Taehan Maeil Sinbo). The Japanese used this beligerent act as a pretext to tighten control and forced 'Kojong' to abdicate the throne to his son. In 1907, 'Sunjong' became emperor, but it became clear very quickly that he was actually just a puppet of the Japanese military command.
