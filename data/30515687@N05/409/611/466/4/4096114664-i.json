This pavilion, smaller when first constructed during the reign of 'Taejong' (3rd king, 1400-1418) in 1412, was named by the king's eldest son, prince 'Yangnyong', who inscribed the building's name on a plaque. It was used for many purposes ranging from receptions for foreign envoys to national examinations. It was destroyed by the Japanese in 1592 and restored in 1867 by the regent. There are 48 pillars supporting this building. The inner ones are round and the other pillars square (symbolizing Heaven and Earth). During the Korean War the building was damaged, but it has been restored through funds from the American-Korean Foundation. Source: Adams, Edward B.
