These jars, called a 'siru', were an important part of daily life. They were used to steam rice cakes. 'The jars are made in special kilns through a method of reduction: flames and air are mixed into a fierce heat. Pine twigs are used to keep the flames intense, and the kiln's smokestack and fuel-hole are closed to intensify the heat. The clay ware controls the humidity and helps purify the jars.'
