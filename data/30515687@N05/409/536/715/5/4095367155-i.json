Vice-Consul\n\n<b>Date</b>: ca. 1904\n\n<b>Place</b>: Asia: South Korea; Seoul\n\n<b>Type</b>: Photographs\n\n<b>Description</b>: Paddock, Gordon (1865-1932) was appointed Secretary of the American Legation in Seoul in 1901, as well as Vice and Deputy Consul General; he became Consul General in 1902. When the Legation closed in November 1905, his duties as Secretary ceased, and the following year he was appointed Vice Consul General. In 1909 he went to Manchuria as Vice and Deputy Consul, first in Harbin and then in Mukden (now Shenyang). In 1910 he began diplomatic service in Persia, as Consul in Tabriz, and then in Tehran. Paddock received commendations for his efforts to protect foreign nationals in Tabriz from a succession of invading troops during WWI and its aftermath. He was assigned to Belgrade in 1922, and to Copenhagen as First Secretary of the American Legation. His final post was as First Secretary of the American Embassy in Paris in 1930, from which he retired later that year.\n\n<b>Inscription/Marks</b>: Inscription in unknown hand: 'Gordon Paddock, U. S.
