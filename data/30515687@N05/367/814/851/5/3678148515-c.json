The first Presbyterian Church of Buffalo, NY has a much different footprint, even in 1889 when the chapel was completed.  This bears little if any resemblance to the present structure, unless drastic modifications were were made...I just don't see it.

Clearly, the window is too narrow to be the chapel and the square base is too large and in the wrong position to be the base of the high tower. The porch is in the wrong position to be the edifice too.  I will try to investigate this.  If you have any additional photographs that are labeled to be our church, please upload them so that i can try to identify them for you..  I am looking for early photographs of the church, especially during construction.", "authorname": "fortbruce", "id": "30510347-3678148515-72157621754039920", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/cornelluniversitylibrary/3678148515/#comment72157621760718744", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "9950064@N03", "iconserver": "1250", "datecreate": "1248186923", "_content": "This building is the Buffalo Crematorium Co. located at 901 Delavan Ave. (Near Delaware Ave.) in Buffalo, NY, across the street from the Forest Lawn Cemetery.
