The buildings were temporary war offices constructed for WWII. Out of frame to the right are more temporary war buildings still left from WWI. The buildings in the picture were taken down in the mid fifties, if I am remembering correctly. The WWI buildings (not in picture) in what is now Constitution Gardens, were not demolished until the 1970s, when Constitution Gardens was built as part of the Bicentennial celebration. Notice the Rainbow Pool (right foreground) is where the WWII Memorial now stands. The pool (actually just a fountain) was demolished for the WWII Memorial construction, but recreated as a part of the Memorial.", "authorname": "kplifescience", "id": "30510347-3678905464-72157629188803701", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/cornelluniversitylibrary/3678905464/#comment72157629188877877", "realname": "", "path_alias": "sakura_from_all_japan", "author": "75955339@N05", "iconserver": "7016", "datecreate": "1328470223", "_content": "Contrary to my previous post, I think this was taken from the west window.
