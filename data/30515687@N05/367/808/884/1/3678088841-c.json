As the boxes added by Whitewall Buick indicate, the building comprised two residences: the diplomat and Secretary of State John Hay lived in one, and his friend and author Henry Adams lived in the other.  Adams, a descendant of two presidents and son of diplomat Charles Francis Adams, was born in Massachusetts but took up residence in Washington after the Civil War, when he was a young man.  He was the anonymous author of the political novel &quot;Democracy&quot; and a great observer of the social and political scene.   He lived in Washington the remainder of his life.", "authorname": "Susan Barsy", "id": "30510347-3678088841-72157629613996126", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3678088841"}, "flarchive:created": 1389684881}
