Looking at the plan in the top left hand corner the road in the front of the school is Long Lane, East Finchley.  I went to school at the Alder County Secondary School for Boys, Long Lane, East Finchley and the little map looks exactly right with a church (hall?) situated at the back of it.  The build date is right and it had an infants section with seperate entrances.  Even the sites for the boys and (ex)girls toilets is right.  The buildings at the bottom of the playground were different (the wood and metal work shops in my time).  So was this an early draft of what was eventually built?  The building was demolished in the 1970s I think but I have been unable to find a picture of the outside.  I am certain a picture exists on the school's records on Friends Reunited", "authorname": "trained_4_life", "id": "30510347-3611678698-72157627497959415", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3611678698"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685393}
