If you look at the picture at the bottom of this page: <a href=\"http://www.tugboatlars.se/Sodertaljeanga.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tugboatlars.se/Sodertaljeanga.htm</a> you can see that it is taken almost at the same place, but probably at a later date since it is slightly altered. And according tho the text it is on the S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Canal, and that is nowhere close to where you put it on the map. Also the picture could not be taken before 1879 as it then was named &quot;H\u00e5llsviken&quot;, and from 1871 &quot;H\u00e5llsviken I&quot; (It was given the name &quot;Nya S\u00f6dertelje&quot; after the refurbishment). In 1930 it was renamed to &quot;Il\u00e4nda Express&quot;, and in 1932 it was demolished.", "authorname": "Carl-Fredric", "id": "30510347-3612001134-72157622243256173", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3612001134"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685131}
