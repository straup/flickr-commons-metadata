It was erected by the daughter whose reclining figure is shown gesturing towards her father's achievements. The sculptor is Robert Taylor - it is signed on one of the urns. It compares closely with Taylor's masterpiece, a monument of 1721 at Peterborough Cathedral.", "authorname": "adfbristol", "id": "30510347-3610689701-72157631782575797", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3610689701"}, "flarchive:created": 1389686188}
