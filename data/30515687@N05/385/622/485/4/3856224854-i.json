Date is 1921. There is some question that this item relates directly to this series, but it was identified as such in the original information, and therefore is included. It actually appears to be a county agent calling on a family. Many of the photographs in this series are very finely composed, and reflect very graphically the spirit of the enterprise.\n\nCollection #23-2-749, item AC-ER-22\nDiv.
