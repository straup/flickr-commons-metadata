At least some of these were taken as early as August 1918, but all were sent to the ''Country Gentleman'' magazine in April 1921. Captions are as follows: Item 35 - ''Doing business with the vegetable grower on a day in late fall when the program of work consisted of vegetable soup and canned pumpkin and squash.'' Item 36 - ''Removing vegetables from blanching in the live steam of the canners and giving them the cold plunge in the tub of cold water conveniently near.'' Item 37 - ''Checking up accounts at the end of the day. The community kitchen aims to be selfsupporting. The management is in the hands of a community committee which makes a flat rate charge to users of the kitchen to cover cost of management. The committee also purchases supplies wholesale for the benefit of the patrons.''\n\nCollection #23-2-749, item AC-ER-38\nDiv.
