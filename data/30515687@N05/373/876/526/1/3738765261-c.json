There were two collisions at about 12:15 p.m. on April 8, 1918.\n\nThe Empire State Express was westbound when it crashed into the wreckage of a freight train that had just derailed near the foot of Henrietta Street, according to Tony Pacelli\u2019s history book, \u201cPast and Present.\u201d The engineer, John R. Botts of Albany, and the fireman, William Barringer, were thrown about 600 feet when the engine\u2019s boiler exploded. Botts died that day, and Barringer died three days later. An eastbound passenger train, the New England Express, subsequently crashed into the derailed cars.\n\nIt was considered miraculous that there were only two fatalities among the 60 people injured. Edward Davies of Syracuse, the engineer of the New England Express, suffered a fractured skull. Davies saw the collision of the Empire State and the freight train, but his passenger train couldn\u2019t stop in time.\n\nEyewitness Helen J. Murphy told Pacelli, \u201cI recall a steam whistle on one of the engines continued to blow for some time.\u201d\n\nPacelli printed pictures showing horses and passengers being led to safety. Another picture showed people under umbrellas, looking at passenger and freight cars scattered over the four tracks of the railroad main line, near Erie Canal Lock 11.\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dailygazette.com/weblogs/bcudmore/2011/nov/30/112911_cudmore/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dailygazette.com/weblogs/bcudmore/2011/nov/30/112911_...</a>", "authorname": "Ohlhous", "id": "30510347-3738765261-72157629401289544", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3738765261"}, "flarchive:created": 1389683878}
