He was a cook in WWII and was last living in Healesville Vic from 1963-1975 and worked as a cook from 1963-1972 at the Alpine Retreat Hotel in Warburton Vic.\nIf anyone can confirm the soldier's name or all of these soldiers it would be much appreciated. William also served in WWI in France 1917. William's brother Albert Horace Smith died at Fromelles June 1916.\nWilliam was born in Bega under the true name of William Ernest Smith 1891.", "authorname": "youneice", "id": "30095375-2983845132-72157629472921193", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/2983845132/#comment72157629789614869", "realname": "Judy Berry", "path_alias": "judyberry", "author": "38958089@N03", "iconserver": "5021", "datecreate": "1334110978", "_content": "My dad was in 3 Batallion RAR - but was enlisted as Leonard (Len) Morris because he was 15 years old and ended up in Korea for 4-6 weeks)  His real name is Len Berry - does anyone have any info.
