The wedding took place on 12 June 1943 at St Michael's Church, Flinders Street, Surry Hills, Sydney. \n\nThe best man was Flight Sergeant William Martin, and the bridesmaid Cpl Margaret Mitchell Armstrong. Both the couple and their attendants were at the time of the wedding posted to 2 Aircraft Depot, Richmond. \n\nThe wedding dress was purchased second hand by the bride's mother because the family could not assemble enough coupons under wartime rationing to buy a new one. The bridesmaid wore a dress that she had previously worn when bridesmaid to another bride pre-rationing restrictions.\n\nRights Info: No known copyright restrictions.\n\nThis photograph is from the Australian War Memorial's collection <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au</a>\n\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/P05137.002\" rel=\"nofollow\">cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/P05137.002</a> \n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "12505", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1943-06-12 16:11:09", "lastupdate": "1348055994", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1256020618"}, "originalsecret": "6c6c8c49f8", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2503", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/4028103861/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
