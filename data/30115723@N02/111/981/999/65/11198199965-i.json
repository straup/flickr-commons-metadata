In appreciation of the good work done by Dutch personnel and Australian nurses and staff, on arrival in New Zealand, the New Zealand Government gave them a three day trip to the Chateau Tongariro in the snow country. Transport, accommodation, meals, snow and sporting equipment were provided at government expense. After the long and hazardous sea voyage this was a little bit of heaven. After some strenuous outdoor exercise these nursing sisters assuage their thirst with natural ice blocks.\n\nRights Info: No known copyright restrictions.\n\nThis photograph is from the Australian War Memorial's collection <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au</a>\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/150875\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au/collection/150875</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1149", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1942-06-06 16:04:42", "lastupdate": "1387806421", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1386128982"}, "originalsecret": "9ce3e521bf", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5478", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/11198199965/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
