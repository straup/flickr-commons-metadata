When I notified the AWM of my discovery  as our mother was given up for adoption in 1929 of our natural grandfather and found he had two seperate war files as he lied when he signed up in 1936, his two files were made into the one file. He must of been a handsome man.  William served as a Private 3rd Battalion Pioneer and sailed 26 September 1916 on the Benalla and served 29th Battallion/35th Battallion/3rd Pioneer Battallion until  21 June 1918. 17 years later:  WWII, Wiliam served as Sergent 4th Australian Base Ordnance Depot, Watchman and changed to being a Cook, in his war files it states he did a cooking course in the army. In 1946 he requested to go to Japan. He was awarded a STAR, British War Medal and a Victor Medal (2329).  Check my website for more information of William Ernest Smith <a href=\"http://www.smithhoward.weebly.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.smithhoward.weebly.com</a> \nWilliam's brother, Private Horace Smith, Unit No 4526A, 54th Battallion, AIF, DIED 19/20th July 1916 in France buried at Ration Farm Military Cemetery, La Chapelle-Darmentieres.\nAny photos of these units would be welcoming. The AWM in Canberra has a painting of a  male cook, unknown portrait, dated 1945. The person who sat for this portrait, resembles my mother's features and my own and kin. In my heart, he is our grandfather but do not have proof.", "authorname": "youneice", "id": "30095375-2864504990-72157626148994618", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-memorial/2864504990/#comment72157633855034874", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92277020@N07", "iconserver": "7334", "datecreate": "1370095751", "_content": "nice picture!", "authorname": "janetdye65@yahoo.com", "id": "30095375-2864504990-72157633855034874", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2864504990"}}
