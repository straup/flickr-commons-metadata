The forest-woods include the quebracho, the nundbay (acacia) lapacho (bignonia, red and white cedar, amarillo (mimosa) the palm-tree introduced by the Jesuits, poplar, willow, walnut, and the celebrated yerba mate, whose leaves make a stimulating tea. the valuable quebracho (break-axe) takes a hundred years to arrive at maturity. It is largely used in the making of railway sleepers, etc., and also provides an export trade of about a quarter million tons annually, mainly for tanning purposes. This wood bears so strong a resemblance to red marble that it is a difficult matter to distinguish between the two. \u00a7 The (Gran Chaco&quot;, the northern division of the country, is singularly interesting. It is the home of hte native Indian tribes, and , in sharp contrast to the Mendozan area, its climate is tropical. Its fauna include the jaguar, the puma, wildcat, fox, tapir, many varieties of deer, and the alligator. The north is marshy, and the south covered with dense forests. The capital of the Chaco is Resistancia.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 033\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
