It sounds like a pig in the hands of a butcher. They surely cannot kill hogs here in the midst of the city. It is only the creaking of a farm cart which is bringing wheat to the market. There it comes through the door. it has wheels eight feet in height, with hubs as big around as your waist, and an axle as thick as a telegraph pole. \n\nThe cart has an arched cover of reeds over its bed. The kinds which have been sewed to the top are put there to keep the rain off the wheat. Such farm carts take the place of wagons throughout Argentina. they look very rude,  but each cart will hold several tons--so much , indeed, that teams of twelve oxen are often hitched to one car.'&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 039\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
