It was for merely thirteen miles of line running westward from the capital, and it began working in 1857. Between that date and 1909 the railway mileage increased to 16,600 miles, this representing an average construction of new line at the rate of 319 miles per annum. La Pampa is the territory with the greatest mileage in railways, and it is estimated that this mileage is likely to be doubled at no distant date. The total railroad mileage of the country is 22,310 miles. &quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 025\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
