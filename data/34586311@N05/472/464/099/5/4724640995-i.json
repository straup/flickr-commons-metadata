As at present laid out the city is about eleven miles from end to end. Within its boundaries there is twice as much land as in Paris. Buenos Aires has more than a million and a half of inhabitants and is growing very rapidly, due to the high birth rate among her vast foreign population and the great influx of immigrants, chiefly from the south of Europe, who thrive in its temperate climate so like their own. Buenos Aires is the largest Spanish speaking city in the world, and next to Paris, the world's largest Latin city. Among American cities it ranks fourth in population with all points favoring an early advance into third place or even higher. &quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 002\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
