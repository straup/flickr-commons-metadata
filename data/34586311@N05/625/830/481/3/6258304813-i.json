Kenneth Munford Collection\n\nItem Number: MSSMumford141 \n\nImage Description: Martha Henderson Gross is standing with &quot;Old Mill Stones&quot; monument. &quot;The first mill stones or burrs were used in this section of Oregon. They were originally quarried in France and shipped round the Horn from New York in 1850 by a sailing vessel. In 1852 they were hauled by ox cart from Portland to King's Valley and there set up and operated as one of the three first grist mills in the state. There were in constant use for over 60 years.&quot;--from legend on base of the stones.The mill stones were later installed in Avery Park. They were hauled by team and wagon from Chambers' Mill in King's Valley to the old Pioneer Park around 1925. \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
