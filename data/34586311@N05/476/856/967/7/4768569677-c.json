Opp corner to American College and Davenport was my guess. And I was hoping to compare frontages (and chimney patterns) on the lefthand side of &quot;Clare Street&quot; though before declaring. However the protruding bay/balcony put me off. As did the bricked up arched window on top floor of same building. But the main concern was the fact that each house is three windows &quot;wide&quot; in this shot.
