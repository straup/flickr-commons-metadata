These are being sold to reliable young families who are paying on an amortization plan extending over 68 1/2 years. This picture shows Mrs. Jack Dooyar in front of the house in which she and her husband lived for years as laborers on the estate. Because of their faithful service, they were given the opportunity to buy one of the small farms. They are now raising potatoes, cabbage, mangles, turnips, oats and hay. They have 8 cows, 20 sheep, 20 pigs, and 200 fowl. All this is on 40 acres.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 050 007\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
