She looks a lot like my grandmother, Lydia Davis, who lived in Corvallis during that period and had close ties to Oregon State. I know that she, my mother, and my aunt picked beans and other crops during the years that my mother attended Corvallis High and Oregon State. Also, I have a hat of hers in my closet which looks very similar to the one in the photo. The dress doesn't look like any I've seen in photos of her, however.", "authorname": "bonniebronleewe", "id": "34580971-4204026476-72157623227457015", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/4204026476/#comment72157623352288918", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1265320318", "_content": "Good question!
