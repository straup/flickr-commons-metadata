Mothers would take their turn to bring hot food for the School Kids.   In some parts of America the Lunch brought from home was very little.   I know one Little Boy who would bring his scanty lunch in an old Syrup pail.    He  tried to trade  his Brown Sugar sandwich for a sandwich with meat.   There was no  trade and he ended up eating his dried out bread with brown sugar on it.     I wrote the sad, story called:  The Brown Sugar Sandwich.     This is a Great Photo of DAYS GONE BY !", "authorname": "Norskejenta1", "id": "34580971-6170244334-72157628062901414", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/6170244334/#comment72157628026699999", "realname": "Alyss", "path_alias": "alyssssyla", "author": "7389807@N06", "iconserver": "175", "datecreate": "1321551629", "_content": "This is a wonderful photo!
