I dream of creative places they can visit such as like these grounds. Almost like the feelings, I get when I visit the places I've found hear in Memphis's Historical Areas and along the Parks and River areas.  Most all these grounds of this quality are seasonal, private and have a paid serious security team to insure there upkeep, as they're not open to the community. I can still see my self standing in the middle of sunlight having a good time with my Easel and Oil Paintings, Acrylics,  and  Portable Music Stand, My Customized  Music Books along with my paper work and Acoustic Guitar or an Electric with amplifier and suspended speakers in the air.  Just like I do my dreaming and practicing hear when I can get away with it hear at the Parks, Schools  and Mississippi River, Tourist Areas, Churches, Parlors, Basements, Business, Malls, Parking Lots and Hotel Lobbies and Bedrooms hear and other locations as the residents workers and tourist walk by on there way to and from spending and making there monies.", "authorname": "samuelfcampbell2003", "id": "34580971-5139858605-72157625875962112", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5139858605"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681716}
