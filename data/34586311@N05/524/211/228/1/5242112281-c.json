It is exhibited by Attilio Piccirilli, the artist who designed the Maine Memorial in New York City. The appeal of &quot;An Outcast&quot; is too direct to need any illumination. Its frank bigness and physical power and tenseness, so suggestive and so desperate, are Rodinesque. But though the work is influenced by that master's school and thought, it is by no means a copy of his method. This sculptor has a number of interesting groups in the exhibit palaces and has been granted a gold medal. The dejected and desolate Outcast, so huge and so tragic, is in sharp contrast with the quaint and fanciful &quot;Fawn's Toilet,&quot; by the same hand, at the entrance to the Colonnade. Attilio and Furio Piccirilli, whose work has been here noticed, are brothers, members of a family of sculptors.&quot; (from <a href=\"http://www.books-about-california.com/Pages/Sculpture_and_Mural/Sculpture_Illustration_076.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sculpture and Mural Decorations of the Exposition</a>.)\n\nWant to learn more about the Panama Pacific International Exposition of 1915?
