In every mountain district maturely dissected by glaciers, are to be found sharp horns of large base and especially of the com-bridges. They are further in contrast with the latter by having an approximately pyramidal form, and a base most frequently a triangle with flatly in-curving sides. They appear most frequently at the junction points of the comb-ridges between three or more important snow-fields. Such forms are generally termed &quot;horns&quot; in the Alps, and the word being of the same form in English, it may well be retained as a technical expression. The Matterhorn in Switzerland is the type par excellence, though similar and almost equally striking examples are numerous.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 022\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
