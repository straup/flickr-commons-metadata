It will readily be seen, therefore, that there were lakes gathered on the north. As the ice melted farther back these lakes became greater in size and often changed much in form. But in time the ice melted out of the Mohawk Valley in New York and the drainage of these glacial Great Lakes poured out between the Adirondacks and Catskills to the Hudson and the sea. Still later, the glacier melted out of the St. Lawrence Valley, and the Great Lakes came to their present levels and forms. \n\n We are now to look at the proof of these earlier glaciers.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 009 \n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
