Such hills are shaped like drumlins, but are often much higher and steeper, and, unlike the drumlins, consist of bed-rock, except the surface coating of boulder clay. They often show a somewhat fluted surface, the fluting being parallel with the longer axis of the elevation.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 015\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
