Existing examples are confined to Greenland and to Antarctic regions. Others that have now vanished left unmistakable records over large portions of northeastern North America and northwestern Europe. The principal characteristic of continental glaciers are their vast extent, their comparatively level surface, and the prolongation of portions of their borders into lobes and even into well-defined streams, were the topographic and other conditions are favorable.
