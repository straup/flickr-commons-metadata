At each halt of the receding ice sheet a terminal moraine was built with lobes extending down the valleys. These moraines are low, hummocky hills, with enclosed basins, or kettles often occupied by ponds. \n\nWe have seen these proofs of the great ice sheet of North America that developed during the glacial period. Let us now look at some of the glaciers of the present time.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 021\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
