When it begins to move, it becomes a glacier. Not all snow-fields give rise to glaciers, but all glaciers have their sources in snow-fields. \n\nFor convenience of reference the glaciers now known may be arranged in three classes, alpine, piedmont, and continental. These three classes are not always distinct and clearly separable, but typical examples of each may be selected that are well characterized, and differ in essential features from typical examples of each of the other classes. In each group there are conspicuous variations which suggest minor or more specific subdivisions.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 003\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
