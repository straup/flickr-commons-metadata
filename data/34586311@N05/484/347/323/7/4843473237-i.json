The change is very distinct in the last banks of snow in the spring. They are made up of coarse grains (granules)  of ice, sometimes as larges as peas. The change from flakes of snow to granules of ice is due, in part, to the melting of the snow and the freezing of the water. If there is much snow, it is compressed by its own weight, and after being compacted in this way, the freezing of the sinking water binds the granules together. By this and perhaps other process, the large part of every thick snow-field becomes an ice-field merely coated over with snow.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 012 002\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
