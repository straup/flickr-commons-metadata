It is one of the most interesting cities in the world. Its location was first determined by some high ground on the banks of the Thames, where a bridge could be built across the river. Modern London has grown up around this bridge. The city is far inland and is surrounded by plains. Easy means of transportation has been one of the great natural advantages of its location, and it has become a railroad and manufacturing center. its position on the eastern side of the islands is a natural advantage, for the commerce with the countries of western Europe, naturally comes to this port. The river is lined for miles with docks, and yet there are not places enough for the vessels that are in this port at one time. London was for many years the largest city in the world but was displaced by New York when the latter consolidated with adjacent cities. Now London again ranks first with a total population of 7,476,168.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 021\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
