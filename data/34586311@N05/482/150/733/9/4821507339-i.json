Paris, the capital of the French Republic, is a very beautiful city, with broad boulevards and numerous buildings of unusual interest. In its great museums are many of the world's most precious works of art. This city is located on the Seine and is in the midst of a rich agricultural country. it is also on the highway of travel from the Mediterranean countries northward through the valley of the Seine. Paris is an important railroad center and is also a port for the smaller ocean-going vessels.\n\nMany different industries were established here because it was easy to bring in raw material and to distribute manufactured goods from this center.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 018\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
