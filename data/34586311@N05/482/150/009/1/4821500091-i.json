Moscow is now the capital of Soviet Russia and is much more centrally located than Leningrad. It is on one of the tributaries of the Volga and in the midst of forests which have furnished an abundance of fuel and building material. Rivers have made it possible to bring to this center raw material, such as flax and grains from the agricultural districts. Coal is obtained a little south of the city, and Moscow has become a manufacturing center. Cotton, linen, and woolen goods are made here. This city is also an important trading center and one from which machinery is distributed to the great farming regions of Russia.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 016\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
