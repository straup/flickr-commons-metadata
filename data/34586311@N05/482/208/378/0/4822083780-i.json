In the new city, residential districts are segregated from commercial and industrial districts. Six new avenues from 100 feet to 150 feet wide cut across the most crowded sections supplementing the old main thoroughfares, while more than one hundred new streets with a minimum width of 36 feet, replace the old narrow crooked lanes and streets. Fire-proof zones have been planned and the government is subsidizing the erection of fire-proof buildings. \n\nTokyo proper has a population of 2,036,000 while Greater Tokyo, following the plan of consolidating former suburbs, announced its population in August, 1925, as 3,859,674.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 005\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
