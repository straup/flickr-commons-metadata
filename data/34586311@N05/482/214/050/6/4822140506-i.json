Beunos Aires, the capital of the republic, is now the largest city in South America. About one fifth of the entire population of Argentina live in this city. Like Chicago, Buenos Aires is built on flat land, and yet, like Chicago, Buenos Aires had the advantage of a wonderful system of parks and playgrounds. There are seventy- two parks in Buenos Aires, and they are being improved and enlarged every year. \n\nThe harbor at Buenos Aires was not satisfactory, and on account of this fact a great deal of dredging has been done to deepen the water. A very excellent system of stone docks extend for miles along the water front. The Plata River is shallow estuary and not like a real river. The land sank and the sea water came into the mouth of the river, just as it did when Chesapeake Bay was made. \n\nBritish and German people have invested large amounts of money in Buenos Aires and throughout Argentina. Many of the storekeepers are foreigners; some are Spanish, others Portuguese, others Italian. Spanish is the language most commonly spoken; Buenos Aires is, in fact, the largest Spanish-speaking city in the world, larger than any city in Spain&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 023\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
