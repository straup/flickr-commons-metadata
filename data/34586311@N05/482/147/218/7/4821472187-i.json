This name is applied both in China and Japan to any wide highway skirting the water -- along sea shore or river. The principal hotels and club houses are often on &quot;The Bund&quot;, as is the case in this scene. \n\nHankow is the chief commercial city of interior China and is situated about 700 miles from the sea on the Yangze river. The population is one and a half million.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 006\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
