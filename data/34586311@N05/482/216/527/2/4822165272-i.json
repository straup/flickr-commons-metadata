Chicago has no natural harbor, but by widening and deepening the mouth of the Chicago river and by protecting it by breakwaters an excellent harbor has been made. the River itself, which used to flow into the lake, has been transformed into a drainage canal by which the waters of Lake Michigan flow into the Illinois River and finally into the Mississippi. \u00a7 Chicago is the largest meat market in the world and the greatest railroad center.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 028\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
