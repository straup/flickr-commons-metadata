(Estimate, 1925, 1,979,364). Philadelphia was founded by the famous Quaker, William Penn. The name &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; means Penn's woods, and &quot;Philadelphia: means brotherly love. Here is the famous Independence Hall, where one may see the old bell that first rang out the good news that the Declaration of Independence had been signed. \n\nThe city is located on the Delaware River and is one of the largest and best seaports of the United States. Before the opening of the Erie Canal it was the first city of the country. It now ranks third in size. \n\nIron coal are not far away, and Philadelphia has become an industrial center. More locomotives are made here than in any other city. The chief exports come from the great natural resources of Pennsylvania. The wheat and flour shipped from Philadelphia come by rail from the fertile fields of the interior of the continent.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 027\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
