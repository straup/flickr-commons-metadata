Montreal has a wonder situation. It is a thousand miles from the Atlantic and is on a great navigable river which is the outlet of the Great Lakes. But for one handicap is ice, for from the middle of December to near the end of April the river is frozen. The Ottawa River encircles the city, and logs are drifted down that river from the forested areas to the north-west. \n\nMontreal is now the metropolis of Canada, an important railway center, and the terminus of many steamship lines. Large harvests of wheat come to Montreal from the West, in part by way of the Great Lakes and in part by rail. Lumber and wood pulp are made of the logs that are sent down the Ottawa River. The grain coming into the city has led to the establishment of flour mills and breweries. The route to the south through Lake Champlain and the Hudson valley to New York City is only 420 miles long. Large trans-Atlantic vessels bring European goods directly to Montreal and take away the raw materials which Canada sends to the Old World.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 051 025\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
