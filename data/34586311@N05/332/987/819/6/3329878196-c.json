We point people back to \n<a href=\"http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/\">our site</a> to encourage them to find out more about <a href=\"http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/archive/arch120.html\">our photo collections</a>, more information about downloading other pictures in the OSU Libraries digital collections, <i>or</i> if they want to purchase a cd of the high res image. However, as you point out, the resolution for our Commons images is high, and from what I have heard from Flickr Commons users, this means that images we have in our Commons account are at the resolution they need and downloading isn't an issue.\n\nAs for copyright and attribution... We cannot force people to say that they found the pictures on our Flickr page, or even that the pictures are ours, but we certainly encourage people, in the spirit of scholarship and so that others can find the image themselves, to credit the OSU Archives.", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3329878196-72157616377545706", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3329878196/#comment72157616380269868", "realname": "Eric Hunt", "path_alias": "ericinsf", "author": "39312862@N00", "iconserver": "7340", "datecreate": "1238939737", "_content": "Thanks for the info!", "authorname": "Eric Hunt.", "id": "34580971-3329878196-72157616380269868", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3329878196"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685118}
