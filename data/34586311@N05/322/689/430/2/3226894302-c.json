If you look at the stones used on this bridge and the ones in my photos they look like the same ones.  I bet they are even the same colors!!  In the FDR Park here in Georgia, it is filled with works by the CCC Camps.  I only live 12 miles from it and just love to go and look at the craftsmanship there!!  This is just an amazing photo and work!!  I would love to see more work and bridges like this around our United States!!!", "authorname": "Moon Shine Photography", "id": "34580971-3226894302-72157622702889253", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3226894302/#comment72157622831692004", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1258580948", "_content": "The work the CCC boys did in Oregon is really quite amazing, including building in the Multnomah Falls area -- which we all appreciate!", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3226894302-72157622831692004", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3226894302"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685500}
