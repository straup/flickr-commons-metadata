On October 25, 1906, Captain H. Lawrence sighted the Tillamook Rock Lighthouse at 3:20 a.m. and the crew altered course to enter the mouth of the Columbia River in thick mist and a rising tide. Under strong winds an attempt was made to wear the ship away from shore, but a heavy northwest squall grounded the <i>Peter Iredale</i> on Clatsop Sands (now called Clatsop Spit), and drove the ship ashore. No casualties occurred in the accident. &mdash; excerpted, <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Iredale\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n\nRemains of the wreck are still visible today.\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Wreck of the Peter Iredale (1906)&quot; by <i>Frank Woodfield</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3229206917/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3339/3229206917_2f11af8d72_m.jpg\" alt=\"Wreck of the Peter Iredale\" alt=\"Wreck of the Peter Iredale by osucommons\" /></a> \n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Patience [Peter Iredale] (2009)&quot; by <i>Wendi  Andrews</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wendiandrews/3772314600/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3552/3772314600_66bedd1f4d_m.jpg\" alt=\"patience\" alt=\"patience by wendiandrews\" /></a>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "34580971-3229206917-72157623985274639", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3229206917/#comment72157624110002738", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1274492842", "_content": "Great details -- thanks Pixel Wrangler!\nTiah", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3229206917-72157624110002738", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3229206917/#comment72157624231708246", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1276013966", "_content": "You may have already seen these sites, but I found more information <a href=\"http://www.columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/peter_iredale_shipwreck.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=46BA6E65-E25C-D9AA-D7FC7372D31F88D6\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3229206917-72157624231708246", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3229206917/#comment72157624110955987", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1276053913", "_content": "Those are great links!  &nbsp; I especially liked reading the findings in the <i>Transcript of the Naval Court</i> (at the first link) -- it certainly gives the feel of a &quot;first-hand report&quot; of the shipwreck!", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "34580971-3229206917-72157624110955987", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3229206917"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682996}
