These originated with the thought and vision of N.F.S. Grundtvig, historian, and teacher who was beginning bishop, historian, and teacher who was beginning his great work a little less than a century ago. Their educational aim is &quot;to give clear notions of the civic community and the conditions of its welfare, an appreciation of the national character and the ability to express one's thoughts with ease and vigor, freedom and propriety.&quot; Five months' courses for men are given in the winter and three months; courses for women in the summer. Some technical training is given. With this the young men and women, for two generations, have been getting a vision of rural life in all of its fullness and an appreciation of the value of unselfish service. It was in 1856, on Bishop Grundtvig's 70th birthday, that a wealthy party in Copenhagen presented him with equipment for the fourth school to be established and developed under his personal direction. This school was located at Lynby. It is fairly typical of the 79 high schools and Agricultural Colleges which have an annual total enrollment of 8100 students.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 067 031\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
