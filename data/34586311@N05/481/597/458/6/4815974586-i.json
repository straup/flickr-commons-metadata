Here at one of them the farmers are bringing in their milk. There are about 1400 of these cooperatives. They are amalgamated into dairy unions and 546 of them are members of the 11 butter export associations. About 86 percent of the dairy cows (of which there are just a few more than in Iowa) are under theses dairies, and thus a corresponding part of the milk and butter production goes through them.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 067 013\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
