In this he is bringing together students form different nations and applying Bishop Grundtvig's principles of education to the problem of bridging &quot;the gulf of estrangement and suspicion, which exists among the nations of the world.&quot;\n\nBack of the teachings of the Folk High Schools and closely interwoven in all their work there are the principles of Christianity. Bishop Grundtvig was a leader in the church. He tried to establish a type of education which would fit young men and young women to live better Christian lives. &quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 067 036\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
