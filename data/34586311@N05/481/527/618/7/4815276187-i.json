The men have a five months' course in the winter and the women go for three months during the summer. Among the 22,000 members of this society there are now many hundred who have had this training. During recent years the director of the school has been a widely known educator, Jacob Lange. The institution itself is one of the beauty spots of Denmark. \n\nTruly Denmark is a land of schools. It is these which have made possible the development of farmers' organizations. Education is compulsory between seven and fourteen years of age. Intelligence is widely diffused. By the census of 1922 there were 4, 509 lower schools, instruction mostly gratuitous, with 505,448 pupils, and 70,000 students in the higher institutions. The University of Copenhagen founded in 1479 has 3,300 men and women students.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 067 024\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
