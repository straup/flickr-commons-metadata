In 1855, the legislature changed it once more to Corvallis but the Federal Government refused to acknowledge the change. As a result, both houses of the legislature met in the Territorial Capital in Corvallis on December 3, 1855 and passed a bill that changed the capital back to Salem. The legislature reopened in Salem on December 18, 1855, where it has stayed since. \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
