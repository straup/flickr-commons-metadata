It is situated in a narrow and very fertile valley. From this position on one of the routes leading to the top of Mt. Gerizim the white stone houses, with here and there beautiful green trees, make a picturesque scene. \n\nThe town reminds one much of Jerusalem. the streets are narrow and dirty, and their being over arched in many places makes them quite dark. The bazaars, perhaps are the most interesting spectacle of modern Nabulus. The chief industry of the town is the manufacturing of soap. \n\nThe section of the town nearest this standpoint is the Samarian quarter. Mountain Ebal is beyond. After the Israelites crossed the Jordon, half of the people stood over there. likely in yonder cove where the olive trees now appear. and half on this side on Mount Gerizim, and the blessing and cursing were read from the book of the law. (Joshua 8:33-34). This position accords well with the narrative in Jotham's parable, (Judges 9:7-21)&quot;  \n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 033\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
