Ezekial, the prophet, says that it was shut in his day and must bot be opened for any man, &quot;for the Lord, the God of Israel hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut.&quot; Ezekial 44:1,2. Traditionally, this is the Beautiful Gate of Acts 3:2, but that gate was evidently much nearer to the Temple. But actually dates from the fifth or perhaps the seventh, Christian century. It was restored in 1892; it is still architecturally interesting from the inside, where a staircase ascends to the roof.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 014\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
