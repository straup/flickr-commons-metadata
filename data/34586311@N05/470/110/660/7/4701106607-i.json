It is commonly called Mary's Well, but is known also as Jesus' Spring and Gabriel's Spring. It stands beside the Greek Church, which is called the Church of Gabriel or the Church of the annunciation. The church is modern and its being half under ground gives it an unusual though not unpleasant appearance. The spring is north of the church and the water is conducted past the altar by a conduit to Mary's Well, which is the Fountain of the Virgin here seen in this view.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 037\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
