The width of the plain here is sixteen miles and would require fully five hours by ordinary travel from this point, to gain the foot of the mountains of Moab, which may be seen beyond the plain. \n\nThe ruins of ancient Jericho of Joshua' time are around the mountain to the left of this picture just beyond the vision. The Jericho of Herod in the time of Christ is supposed to have occupied a position on the plain at the foot of this descent. The bed of the Jordon is about the center of the plain. \n\nOn the left may be seen the path on the northern bank of the brook Cherith. The path begins at the Elijah Convent. After leaving Elijah Convent, the path traverses the side of the gorge, very precipitous above and below. Numerous are the caverns and cells which have accommodated hermits and anchorites for many centuries. These caves may be seen on either side of the gorge.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 024\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
