The colossal block is 71 feet long, 14 feet high, 13 feet wide, contains about 13,500 cubic feet, and would probably weigh, 1,500 tons. Men on top of it look like little dolls, while the people and camels below seem as mere toys. The block rests on a narrow ridge of rock running down the center, each side underneath being cut away preparatory to moving. \n\nAll around in this immense quarry are such sights as you may see beyond this block-stone partially prepared for removal. The temple built of the stones of this quarry stands in ruins in the distance. The six columns of the great temple rise prominently and on this side of them, 20 feet from the ground, are three large stones in the wall similar to the one here in the quarry, each 63 feet long, 13 feet wide, 13 feet high, weighing probably 1,000 tons each. \n\nOne of the unexplained wonders connected with the famous ruins of Ballbek is how the gigantic stones were transported and placed in position on the wall so high above the ground.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 046\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
