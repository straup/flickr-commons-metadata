It was first mentioned in the Bible in Abraham's time (Gen. 14:15) It is altogether likely that Abraham stopped here on his way from UR of the Chaldees. It has successfully passed under the dominion of the Assyrian, Babylonians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Saracens, and finally was captured by the Turks in 1516. And today it is still the capital of nearly all Syria, and is the most populous and flourishing city of the East.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 045\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
