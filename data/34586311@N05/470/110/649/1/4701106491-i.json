Near the foot of the mountain overlooking the plain, stands a rocky plateau which tradition has fixed upon as the site of the two rival altars. Around one altar stood the four hundred priest of Ball, shouting hoarsely for their god to send the fire upon the waiting sacrifice, but calling in vain. By the other altar stood Elijah alone, the prophet of Jehovah, lifting his solitary voice to God. In a moment his prayer was answered; the fire fell from the heavens;the offering was burned; the water in the trench around it was licked up; even the dust upon the altar was consume and its stones were destroyed under the intense heat; while the people shouted with one voice. &quot;Jehovah, He is God!&quot;&quot;   \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 035\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
