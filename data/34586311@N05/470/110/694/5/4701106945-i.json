Hermon lies Banias. This is the modern representative of the Ancient Caesarea Philippi, and the more ancient Paneas. \n\nThis picture is taken from a spur of Hermon looking over the modern town which consists of about fifty stone houses. Most of these are within an ancient castle wall. Remains of columns show that the ancient city extended much farther to the south. The chief object of interest, however, at Banias is the source of Jordon, which boils forth from ancient ruins and rocks, below the western end of castle hill. \n\nThe evidences of a temple to the Greek god Pan at the grotto above the spring gave the ancient name Paneas. When Philip, the Tetrarch, inherited this region, he rebuked the town and called it Caesarea, the name Philippi being added later. \n\nThis is probably the most northerly point ever visited by Christ (Matt. 16:13). An early tradition makes this the scene of the healing of the woman with the issue of blood (Matt. 9:20). Eusebius says he saw, at Banias, bronze statues representing Jesus, and the woman on bended knee. Later writers make the heights of some lofty peak of Mt. Hermon the more probable place of transfiguration (Matt 17:1), as Christ was in the borders of Caesarea Philippe just previous to that transcendent occurrence in the Gospel narrative. There is no doubt as to the identity of this town with the biblical Caesarea Philippi.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 042\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
