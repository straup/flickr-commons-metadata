This is very likely the same region where Boaz owned his field. The story abounds in allusions and customs, primitive and oriental, many of which are readily illustrated by the manner and of the present occupants of the land. In harvest season reapers may be seen with their crooked sickles and following them, men, women, and children, gleaning as the maidens of Boaz were doing when he came from Bethlehem to look after his reapers. The salutations and responses are the same today as in the time of Boaz. \n\nAs of old it is still customary to see large crowds who come from great distances to the fields in harvest. It is not unusual for the husband and wife. and all the family to camp near the field and remain until the harvest is over. In Ruth 3:15, mention is made of Boaz filling the veil of Ruth with barley. Similar veils are worn now, as may be seen on the heads of the women. It is merely a long piece of cloth, and is often used for just the same service as that to which Ruth applied hers.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 005\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
