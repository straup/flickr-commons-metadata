The town is about twelve miles from Jerusalem along the Jaffa road.\n\nThere is very little doubt but that Abu Gaush is the site of Kirjath-Jearim. Its identification due to Dr. Robinson has met with general acceptance. Kirjath-Jearim is frequently mentioned in the Bible. It was assigned to Judah by Joshua. It was a city of the Sibeonites, but of more biblical interest than all else is the fat that here in the house of Abinadab, who was of Levitical family, rested the ark for 20 years after it was brought up from Beth Shemesh. And here it remained until David brought it up to Jerusalem.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 027\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
