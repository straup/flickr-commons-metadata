Long before the Hebrew occupation of Palestine, this striking formation led the ancients to view this as a Holy mount. Its length is about 58 feet, the breadth nearly 52 feet. It extends above the surrounding pavement from four to six and half feet. Here on Mount Moriah, which is called also Zion, Abraham was about to offer Isaac. Here by the threshing-floor of Araunsh, David saw the destroying angel. Here also Solomen built the temple, but this rock was not within it as it is within the Mosque. It is probable that the altar of sacrifice stood on the rock. \n\nThe interior of the Mosque, which is an octagon with sides 66 feet 7 inches in length, is 174 feet in diameter. It is divided by its two series of supports into three concentric parts. The pillars were all taken from older buildings. An inscription in the oldest Arabic character, Cufic, records that &quot;Adballah el-Iman el-Melik, prince of the faithful erected this dome in the year 72-692 A.D.[&quot;] It is in the Arabian style.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 010\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
