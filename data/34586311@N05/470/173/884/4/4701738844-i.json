It is built over the supposed Holy Sepulchre. It has no architectural beauty at present, if it ever had any, for it has been repeatedly destroyed and restored. \n\nThe church is a very interesting site in Jerusalem to the Christian, because for more than sixteen hundred years it has been accepted as genuine for Mt. Calvary. It is so considered yet except by a few scholars who maintain that this church could not be the true site and point to the Calvary and the Garden Tomb outside the Damascus Gate.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 011\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
