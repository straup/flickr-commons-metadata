It is the most southern city of Palestine. Here are found seven wells, two large ones and five smaller ones called Abraham's wells. \n\nPerhaps no other name is better known in Palestine than is Beer-Sheba. It was first assigned to Judah and after-wards to Simeon (Josh. 15:28, 19;2) On the return from Exile, Beer-Sheba was again peopled by Jews. In Roman times Beer-Sheba was a very large village with a garrison. It was the seat of a bishopric in the early Christian times before the country was conquered by the Muslims.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 002\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
