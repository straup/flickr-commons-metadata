Gerizim on the left and Mt. Ebal on the right. Jews, Christians, and Moslims [sic] agree that this is the very well from which &quot;our father Jacob drank.&quot; \n\nThe well has been made sacred by that marvelous conversation had there with the woman of Samaria (John4: 1-43). This is the only precise spot on earth which we may [be] sure was hallowed by his sacred presence and rendered memorable forever by his divine teaching.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 030\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
