The walls ascending sharply from the valley give to the town an appearance of great strength. The town within the walls covers 209 acres, but the city extends outward in several directions, especially to the west and north. \n\nBelow this viewpoint, to the left, is the Russian church in their Garden of Gethsemane. Immediately below that and to the right where are seen several tall cypress trees is the Latin Garden of Gethsemane. The road at the extreme right of the picture is the one leading down from the St.Stephens gate where the Nebi Musa Pilgrimage is see. At almost the central point of the picture may be seen the two arches of the golden Gate in the eastern wall of Jerusalem. the open space beyond the wall is the temple area where Solomon;s temple stood. The Platform, raised sixteen feet above the surrounding area, in the center of which is the octagonal Mosque of Omar with its large dome, is clearly noticeable. The high, modern-looking tower seen beyond and a little to the right of the Mosque of Omar belongs to the German Church of the Redeemer, finished in 1898.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 017\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
