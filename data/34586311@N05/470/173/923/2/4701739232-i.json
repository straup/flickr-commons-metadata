Two places are claimed as the site of Gethsemane: one by the Latins, and one by the Greeks. It is genuine satisfaction to look upon the Mount of Olives, after trying to locate so many places of uncertain traditions. Of its authenticity there can be no doubt. No other part of Palestine is hallowed by so many memories of Jesus as this hill. He sought its olive groves for retirement and prayer, and there uttered words now familiar to millions of our race; it was from Olivet that he gazed tenderly upon Jerusalem and wept over it (Luke 19:41) and on a portion of this hill &quot;over against Bethany&quot; he gave to his disciples the benediction and parted from them.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 018\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
