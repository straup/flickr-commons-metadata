Tabor, situated in the southwestern part of Galilee rises from the plain of Esdraelon, all of which is below see level. The mountain in lonely grandeur rises to a height of 1,843 feet above the sea. Many springs are found on this lonely peak which feeds the stream descending to the Jordon. \n\nOn this mountain we see trees growing. This is due to the number of springs found on the mountain side. It is of interest to know that the entire country of Palestine might be made fertile and productive. Its development is hindered because it has no settled agriculture population, its present population being wandering Syrians and Arabs who herd their sheep and goats. Within the past fifty years considerable areas of waste land have been brought under cultivation.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 038\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
