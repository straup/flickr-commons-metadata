The lake lies 627 feet below the level of the Mediterranean; the city is on a plain a few feet above the lake. \n\nAfter the destruction of Jerusalem, Tiberias became the seat of many Jewish schools. Here the Mishna was complied and published and about A.D. 220, and the Palestinian Talmud about 420. Here the vowel points were added to the Hebrew Bible about 600 A.D.
