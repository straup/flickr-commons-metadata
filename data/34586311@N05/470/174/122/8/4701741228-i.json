It is built upon the two hills, Mt. Zion and Mt. Moriah. It was on Mt. Moriah that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice. \n\nWhen David conquered the city he took it for his capital. He placed the tabernacle on Mt. Zion and though Solomen after-wards built the temple on Mt. Moriah the name of Zion was so incorporated into the Jewish language by means of the Psalms of David and of religious traditions that the name passed over to the temple mount. Solomen's palace was built on Mt. Zion and the palace was united with the temple by a wide bridge.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 008\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
