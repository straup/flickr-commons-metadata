It was situated on a hill of more than 300 feet elevation and was well adapted for a fortified capital. Its commerce and trader was extensive. In 722 B.C. there came a strong invading army of Assyrians and the city fell into their hands. The most prominent of the population were carried into exile and a mixture of all kinds of people constituted the population from that time on. The ruins here pictured show a part of the ruins of the city gate and wall.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 031\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
