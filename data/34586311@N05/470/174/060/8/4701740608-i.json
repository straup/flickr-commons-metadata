And there is still a doubt as to the actual location of the latter. Many persons apply the name Bethsaida to a place a short way up the Jordon on the east side. Others place it on the west side of the Jordon. But near the shore of the Sea of Galilee this place is pointed out as Bethsaida. \n\nThe name of Bethsiada signifies the house of fishing, and doubtless it derives its name from the occupation of fishing. It is more likely that the town was located on the shore and not several miles away.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 041\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
