The mosque is on the higher level. In the immediate foregrounds is one of the famous fountains of the Temple area, and men may be seen at their religious ablutions. When one reaches the approach it is necessary to rent slippers. They are always kept on hand for the purpose of entering the Mosque and are retained until the visitor finished not only the Mosque of Omar, but also the Mosque el-Aksa on the south end of the area. This is an act of reverence just as we would remove our hats when going into a church. \n\nThe mosque of Omar is in the front of a richly decorated octagon. The lower part of the walls are of white marble and the upper part of porcelain tiles, whose colors blend in harmonious designs.&quot; \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 010 xxx\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
