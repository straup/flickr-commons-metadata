It stands north of Ophel, and somewhat higher. The open square marks the site of Solomon's Temple with the courts that surrounded it.

Directly before us is the southeastern corner of the modern wall, which here follows the course of the ancient wall. We there stood the altar of the temple now rises the Dome of the Rock, generally by wrongly called &quot;The Mosque of Omar&quot;. To the left of this Dome and over the southen wall we see another dome, which is the Mosque el Aksa, and beyond is the Mohammedan quarter of the city. Upon yonder open space, in the days of old, walked David and Solomon, Isaiah and Jeremiah, Christ and the twelve apostles.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 028\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
