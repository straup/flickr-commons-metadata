Do you see in the foreground some steps leading down from the road? That is the entrance to the Pool of Samaria, where the chariot of the slain King Ahab was washed, and his blood dripped out upon the pavement, as foretold by Elijah and narrated by the writer of Second Kings, mean and insignificant as this village is, it has a past of deep interest.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 018\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
