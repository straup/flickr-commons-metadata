It is commonly called &quot;The Mosque of Omar&quot;, but it is not a mosque nor was it built by the Caliph Omar. Yet it is regarded by Mohammedan as one of the most holy places upon the earth, and next in sacredness to the great mosque of Mecca in Arabia. You notice that the buildin is two colors, the upper part dark, the lower light. The upper part is faced with porcelain tiles, the lower part with marble. The smaller domed building on the right, it is said , was built as a model for the larger edifice, and is called &quot;the judgment seat of David.&quot; We will walk across the rockly plateau, take off our shoes, or cover them with slippers, and step inside the Dome of the Rock.&quot;\n \n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 029\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
