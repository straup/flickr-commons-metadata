On this side, the hill is precipitous-more so in ancient times than it is now. It is said that here was the place of execution for criminals, after the Jewish method by stoning. They were hurled over the cliffs upon the rocks, below, and if not slain in the fall, were stoned from above. This gives some reason for the opinion that this may have been the place not only of stoning, but of crucifixion. Try to picture against yonder cloudless sky three crosses rising upon yonder summit, and think that on the middle one may have hung with arms outstretched, the world's Redeemer!&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 034\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
