Here was the threshing floor of Araunah, bought by King David for the site of his altar; but Jewish tradition claims that a thousand years before David, Abraham built his altar on this rock for the sacrifice of Isaac. Without a doubt here stood the altar in Solomon's Temple, and in the two temples that succeeded Solomon's. Think of the great men of the Bible who stood here and worshiped; prophets, priests, kings, apostles, saints! We may well look upon this rock as one of the hallowed places of the earth.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 030\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
