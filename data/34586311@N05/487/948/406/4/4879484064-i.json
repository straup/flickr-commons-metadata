To make it more real, two Syrian girls from the English school , dressed in their native costume, are seated, one at the head, the other at the foot of the receptacle for a body. We cannot say that this was the tomb of the rich Arimathean Joseph; but we can say that it stands in a hill which may have been Calvary; that it belongs to the Roman age; that it was hewn out of the rock that but one burial place in it was completed, although two others were left unfinished; and that the receptacle for the body was such that two people could be seated beside it, as the women found the two angels on that Easter morning. All these facts, with the added possibility that here may have rested the body of Jesus, gives to this place a surpassing interest.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 037\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
