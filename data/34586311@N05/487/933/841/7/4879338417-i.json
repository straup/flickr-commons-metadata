Close at hand we see the northern wall of the city, pierced by the Damascus gate, the very gate through which Saul of Tarsus went forth on his persecuting errand, expecting to scatter the church in Damascus, as he had scattered the church in Jerusalem. That modern building on the right is the Latin Convent and hospice for the entertainment of Catholic pilgrims. You note a large dome standing prominently with a smaller dome beside it; that is the Church of the Holy Sepupchre where a mistaken tradition locates all the events connected with the death and resurrection of our Lord. This part of the city is largely Christian in its population and is more modern and thrifty in appearance than some of the other sections.&quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 035\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
