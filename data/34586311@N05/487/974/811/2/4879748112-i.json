The wise and powerful King Omri selected this site, purchased the hill from its owner, Shener, and named after him the city of Samaria, which he built upon its eastern slope. Omri's capital was well chosen for the site is a commanding one. The hill rises above all its surroundings and most important for a capital city, it was almost impregnable against ancient methods of warfare. From this summit upon every side is a magnificent view, and there still remains an ancient road winding its way around the mountain.quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 017\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
