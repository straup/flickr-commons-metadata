That hill before us is Bethel, one of the early homes of Abraham, where he reared his tent and built his altar. But its chief interest centers in Abraham's grandson Jacob who paused here on the night after he had fled from the anger of his brother Esau, and resting on his stony pillow saw a wondrous vision. Let us hear the poet's story of that dream: 'I saw the Syrian sunset's meteor-crown Hang over Bethel for a little space; I saw a gentle wanderer lie down With tears upon his face. Sheer up the fathomless, transparent blue Rose Jasper battlement and crystal wall. Rung all the night air pierced through and through. With harps angelical. And a great ladder was set up the while From earth to heaven, with angels on each round; Barks that bore precious freight to earth's far isle, Or sailed back homeward bound.'&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 023\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
