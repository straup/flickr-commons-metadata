When the morning came, he descended near to the plain between the hills, called his twelve chosen ones, and to them and to the multitude which had assembled from every quarter of the land, he gave the Sermon on the Mount, the longest discourse found in the New Testament, setting forth the standards of an ideal humanity.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 009\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
