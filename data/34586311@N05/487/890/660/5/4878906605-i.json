It is the Hill Machpelah, bought by Abraham for a burial place. At the foot of this hill stands the city of Hebron, whose history can be traced uninterruptedly through four thousand years. Here Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in their several generations. Here ten centuries after Abraham, David reigned as King of Judah for seven years before he received the crown of all the tribes. Here the conspiracy of wicked Absalom had its beginning, more prosperous and promising than its ending. Here, or not far distant, was the home of the good priest Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth, the parents of John the Baptist. Can you see just in the farther edge of the city, near the right, two towers rising above the roofs? Here are the minarets of the Mosque of Hebron, upon which we look as our next view.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 040\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
