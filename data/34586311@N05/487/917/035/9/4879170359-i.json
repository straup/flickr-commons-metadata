Again we see the city of Shechem, but from its opposite side, the north. The tower which was in the foreground in our last view is now far in the background on the right and scarcely visible. Schechem is the home of that ancient people, the Samaritans, who reject all the bible except the five books of Moses, and have lived apart for nearly twenty-five centuries. They look upon Mount Gerizim just as the Jews looked upon Mount Moriah, for upon it stood their temple. You remember the words of the Samaritan woman to Jesus; 'We worship in this, but ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Let us climb yonder mountain and look at its summit.'&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 020\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
