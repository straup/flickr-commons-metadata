On its eastern border we find three mountains; the northern Mount Tabor; the middle one &quot;The Hill of Moreh&quot; in the Old Testament; often called in modern times &quot;Little Hermon&quot;; the greatest of the three on the south, Mount Gilboa. We are now looking upon Mount Tabor from the summit of the Hill of Moreh or Little Hermon. That village in the middle of the view is Nain, where, on one of his journeys, Jesus raised to life the only son of a widow. Beyond the village over the plain we see the rounded summit of Mount Tabor, the most symmetrical and beautiful in form of all the hills in this land of many hills and mountains.&quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 012\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
