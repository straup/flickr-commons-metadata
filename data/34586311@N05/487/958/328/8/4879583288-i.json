For ten months in the year a crown of snow covers its head, giving it the name, &quot;The Snow Mountain&quot;. Another name in common use is &quot;Jebel each Sheikh&quot;, The Mountain of the Chief. From its regnant appearance like a king upon his throne, the name is appropriate, but in reality it refers to this mountain as the residence of the religious ruler of the Druses, a powerful sect in Syria.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 002\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
