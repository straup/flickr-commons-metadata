On the right is the old wall, on the left the foundations of public buildings and private homes. Who knows but one of these pits may be the cellar under the house of the rich tax-collector Zaccheus, who knows but one of these pits may be the cellar under that house of the rich tax-collector Zaccheus, who entertained Jesus? But our interest at present is not with Jericho, but with that mountain which stands west of the city, beyond the plain. That is called Mount Quaratania. The word means &quot;forty days&quot;; and the name has been given because of the tradition that this mountain was the place of our Lord's fasting and temptation, after his baptism and before his ministry. Beyond this mountain lies that desolate, desert region the Wilderness of Judea which has been generally regarded as the scene of those mysterious forty days and the conflict with Satan's power. Let us cross that plain and obtain a nearer view of Mount Quarantania.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 038\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
