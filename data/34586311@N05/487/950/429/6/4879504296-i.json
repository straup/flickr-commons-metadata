Perhaps you can see that it is perforated with caves. The belief that this was really the place of our Lord's fasting through forty days, led to its becoming for centuries the resort of hermits, who dug out caves in the soft rock and dwelt in them, regarding this mountain as holy ground. But Jesus came to this place - if this be the true location - not with the purpose of fasting or meeting Satan. He came immediately after his baptism and the over-powering outpouring of the Spirit, to meditate, to commune with his Father, and to plan for the new life that opened before him. His fasting was an incident, and unconscious; for, in the intensity of his thoughts and feelings, he never thought of food. It may be that on yonder level summit. he stood and in vision saw the kingdom of the world sweep before his eyes, as in reward if he like Ramses, like Sargon, like Alexander, like Caesar and like Napoleon later, he would live for this world and self, and not for God alone.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 039\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
