We see it in the distance beyond the level plain, here cultivated with care. In the foreground you look down upon the home of a farmer and his family; perhaps the possessor of some of the fields in the distance. The house is built of clay and probably contains but one room. the corner of the only window is seen upon the right. Notice the wall bounding the court in front of the house. In some such home as this, not far away at Nazareth, our Lord may have lived during his youth and early manhood.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 014\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
