You can see plainly that it has been the site of a great building, of which the ruins are scattered around; but whether an ancient fortress or a medieval monastery we know not. Near this place stood Moses, prophet, lawgiver, nation-founder, poet, whose work has remained longer and whose influence has been deeper and more lasting than the work and influence of any other man in the world before the coming of Christ. From their heights he gazed over the landscape, viewing the land that he might not enter, and then alone lay down upon the mount to die. A Jewish tradition says that Moses died from the kisses of God's lips. &quot;But no man dug his sepulchre And no man saw it e'er; For the angels of God upturned the sod, And laid the dead man there.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 044\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
