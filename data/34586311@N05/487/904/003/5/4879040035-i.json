Upon this meadow in the foreground Jesus may have fed the five thousand with the five loaves. Before us stretches the northern end of the Sea of Galilee. Can you see just beyond the shore a mountain rent asunder by a deep gorge? Looking through that ravine you will note another mountain whose summit at this distance looks like a plain, the hill sloping down at each end. That farther mountain is Kurn Hattin or &quot;The double horns of Hattin&quot; generally recognized as the spot where Jesus spoke the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. IF we were nearer we should perceive that what seems to be a plain on the summit of the hill, is a depression. The mount has two peaks and between them a plain on a lower level. Let us follow the ancient road which runs from the shore through the great gash in the nearer mountain, and walk toward that sacred height from which Jesus uttered his blessings and proclaimed the principles of his Kingdom.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n  \nItem Number: P217:set 013 008\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
