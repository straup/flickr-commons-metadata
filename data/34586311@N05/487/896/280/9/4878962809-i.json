We are looking at it now from one of the foothills on the northwest. The view is in midsummer, when most of the snow upon its summit has melted swelling the little stream before us, one of the upper sources of the Jordan; but you can see that snow remains in the ravines that seam the mountain walls. It rises 7166 feet above the level of the Mediterranean Sea, and forms the boundary line between Palestine on the south and Syria upon the north.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 001\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
