On one of these lower hills of the lofty mountain took place that great even in the earthly life of Christ - the Transfiguration - which has forever made this a sacred mountain. One night our Lord climbed these steep mountain walls and was praying, while his three chosen disciples were sleeping. Awaking from their slumber, they saw that a great change had come over their Master's face and form. He had become dazzlingly white and ineffably glorious beaming forth a more than earthly splendor. Beside him stood the prophets of the past, Moses and Elijah; while from the radiant cloud above sounded a voice 'This is my beloved Son; hear ye Him.' it is fitting that the loftiest height in all the land should be associated with this scene in the life of Jesus Christ.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 003\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
