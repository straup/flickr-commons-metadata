The old traditional view, no longer held by scholars, is that the cross and the  tomb of Jesus were within the walls of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the eastern quarter of the city. While the evidence is by no means conclusive, there are good reasons for believing that on yonder green hill, stood the cross of Him who died to save us all. You remember that the place was called Golgoth, which means either &quot;place of skulls&quot; or &quot;like a skull&quot;. This rocky eminence with its two great caves suggests a skull to everyone who sees it form the city wall, where this view is taken. You notice that outspread carpet and the group of people on the roof of a house extending to the wall. This hill has been used as Mohammedan Burial-ground, and you can see the gravestones here and there upon it. Under the hill is a series of caves, made by quarrying the interior for building. These caves are used by shepherds as folds for their flocks.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 033\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
