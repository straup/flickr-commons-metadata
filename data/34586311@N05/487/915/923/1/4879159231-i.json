Here we find the ancient city of Chechem, lying between the twin mountains, Ebal and Gerizim. From the foot of Mount Gerizim, we are looking over the city of Shechem northward to the slopes of Mount Ebal. The story of this place begins with Abraham who pitched his tent and built his altar here, at his first tarrying place in the land of promise before the city was founded; Jacob who came here a century and a half later found a little village established and had a war with its inhabitants. From its central location and its abundant supply of water the city grew and has even been one of the most important places in the land. here Rehoboam came to be crowned king, and here took place the revolution that tore the twelve tribes apart into two nations.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n  \nItem Number: P217:set 013 019\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
