This is a range of hills, having four summits on the east of the city. Our views include the middle of the range, the part most interesting. That prominent building on the hillside with its onion-shaped dome, is a Russian Church; and the tower on the summit of the hill is also Russian building. You can perceive three roads up the hill, that on the left is the highway to Jerusalem and Jericho, in Christ's time haunted by robbers 0 as you remember in the parable of &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;; and even not it is not safe for travelers who are alone. That lower path on the right may be the one over which Christ rode on his traditional Garden of Gethsemane where our Savior bowed in prayer on the night before his cross. Theses old olives may be the descendants of the tree whose leaves rustled over him in his agony.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 032\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
