Every one remembers that when King Solomon built the Temple on Mount Moriah, he sent to Lebanon for cedars to form the roofs of the building and the columns around his own palace. The massive trunks were dragged down to the Mediterranean Sea, floated in rafts to Joppa, and thence carried over the land to Jerusalem. The demands of trade and the wastefulness of successive generations have left only a few groves of these monarchs of the forest remaining, and these few are now carefully guarded. &quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 005\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
