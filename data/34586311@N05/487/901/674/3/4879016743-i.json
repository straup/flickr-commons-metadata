Without doubt it stood there in the days of King Solomon and his friend King Hiram of Tyre. They may have walked arm in arm around its trunk and looked up to its outspreading arms. In the long process of the centuries, its arms have withered and fallen, but its mighty heart is still strong , and the sap still flows in its trunk. This old tree is held in almost idolatrous veneration by the villagers living near it. Festivals are held around it, its remaining branches are hung with votive offerings, and what seems to be worship is rendered to it.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 006\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
