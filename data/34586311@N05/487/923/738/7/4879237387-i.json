Here a whole group of mountains will claim our attention; for Jerusalem stands upon mountains and is surrounded by mountains. We begin with Mount Zion, the largest of its hills. Here is the traditional site of the original city, seen from the new tower over Jaffa gate. You note an ancient and in places half-ruined castle, standing upon the wall. This, according to tradition, is the tower of David, the site of the ancient Jebusite fortress, which David, stormed and took in the opening of his reign. You can see how steep is the ascent from the valley below. Up those rocks swarmed David's warrior; they climbed the wall and smote down the Jebusite defenders. When once the city had been taken, David strengthened its fortifications and made it his capital. That grove of trees surrounded by a wall is in the court of the Armenian Monastery. Those walls have been destroyed and rebuilt many times. The present wall was built by the Sultan Solyman the Magnificent, in the sixteenth century.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 013 026\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
