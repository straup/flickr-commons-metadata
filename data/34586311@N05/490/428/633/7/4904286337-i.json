These fish are of an especially fine variety known as the Chinook or quammat salmon. The shores of the river above and below Astoria are lined with great establishments for curing and canning salmon, and shipping the product to all parts of the world. The fish wheels are not used near the mouth of the river, but near the cascades, where the river is narrow and the rapids force the fish close to the banks, where the wheels take them in enormous quantities. The meshes of the nets catch the fish at the gills and prevent their escape. The number of salmon that ascend the Columbia seems beyond reckoning. They are found by thousands at the great falls of the Snake River, 600 miles from the sea and in Clark's Fork at a still greater distance.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 005\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
