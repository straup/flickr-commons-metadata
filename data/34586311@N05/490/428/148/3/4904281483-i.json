Great ocean liners go 1,000 miles up the river, immense cargoes of grain are brought down the Great Lakes through the Welland canal to Montreal and thence to Europe. \n\nFormerly the ocean steamers which came to Canada stopped at Quebec, because the river channel west of that city was only eleven feet deep; but in 1851 the people began to dredge out the St. Lawrence. IT is now twenty-seven feet deep, and the large vessels from Europe sail right up to Montreal.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 004\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
