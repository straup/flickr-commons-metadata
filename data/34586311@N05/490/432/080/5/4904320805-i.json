It drains a basin more than six times the size of the state of New York, and is also connected by canals with the basins of the Rhine and the Elbe. The river rises in the Black Forest only a few miles from the Rhine and pursues a course of 2,000 miles south through Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Balkan states to the Black Sea. \n\nToday the Danube is traveled more than ever, although it has lost much of its commerce with Asia. It flows through rich countries which are now teeming with people. Cities and towns have grown up on its banks and vast quantities of lumber, manufactured goods, and food products are carried back and forth over its waters. The river is internationalized as far as Ula.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 013\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
