There are always boats floating down from the upper parts of the Seine, and if we should travel up the Marne, which joins the Seine, just outside Paris, we might find a canal by which we could go clear to the Rhine, where other boats would take us out through Belgium and Holland to the North Sea. \u00a7 The river is crossed by thirty-two bridges of various ages and design, each ornamented with trophies commemorating French victories. The oldest is Point euf commenced in 1578 under Henry III; the last and most beautiful is Pont Alexander III, 350 feet long, 132 feet wide, but consisting of a single iron arch. Broad avenues lead from each to beautiful boulevards for which Paris is famous.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 016\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
