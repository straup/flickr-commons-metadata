Its waters have their source in Lake Superior flowing out of that basin through the St. Marys River to the level of Lake Huron, through St. Claire River and Lake on through the Detroit River the across Lake Erie. The mighty waters are poured from the Erie basin into that of Lake Ontario which lies three hundred and thirty feet below. For a distance of nineteen miles from Lake Eire the Niagara is a broad, smooth stream between low drift banks. then the bed drops fifty feet in a half mile and the water rushes and tumbles in its upper rapids to fall 107 feet over the edge of a tremendous precipice just as we see it here. \n\nRarely does tremendous power clothe itself with such beauty of form as it does in these wonderful falls of the Niagara. The eye is filled, winter or summer, with its marvelous wealth of beauty - the rainbow mists, the sparkling foam, the mighty grandeur of form and glory of color in summer, the dazzling brightness of the fairy masonry of winter. The river is estimated to have 5,800,000 horse-power. Because it belongs partly to the United States and partly to Canada, the two governments have made a treaty regarding the use of the water-power. If all the water flowing over the falls were used. it would destroy the beauty of the falls, so the two governments have agreed never to use more than one fourth of the available water-power.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 010\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
