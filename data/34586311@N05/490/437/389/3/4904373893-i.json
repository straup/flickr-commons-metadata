It drains a basin as large as half of the United States proper. The river has many tributaries, and its navigable water ways, if stretched out in only line, would reach about halfway around the globe. From its mouth at Matadi, about one hundred miles inland, the Kongo is more like a long lake than a river. It is five or six miles wide, and in many places three hundred feet deep. From matadi to Stanley pool, about two hundred miles, there is s series of cataracts; but above that to Stanley Falls are more than one thousand miles of open river, upon which steamboats can travel as well as upon the Mississippi or the lower parts of the Hudson. On the south the head waters of its tributaries are not far from the watershed of the Zambezi; on the north the headwaters come very close to those of Lake Albert, Lake Victoria and the other headwaters of the Nile.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 024\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
