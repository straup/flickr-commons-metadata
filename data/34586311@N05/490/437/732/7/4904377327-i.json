Victoria Falls exceeds a mile in width and is 343 feet in height, at low water. During the wet season its volume no doubt far exceeds that of Niagara, but as the entire width of the great river is precipitated into a chasm only 250 yards wide and of a depth equal to that of the river, it is plain that is cannot have the magnificent presentment of Niagara, which is open to the view in unobstructed grandeur. Niagara throughout has a clear and solid volume of water, whereas Victoria Falls during a greater part of the year is much broken up by jutting rocks, and lack the wonderful clearness of the Niagara water.&quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 025\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
