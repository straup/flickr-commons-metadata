The sinking of the northwestern part of Europe allow the sea to flow in and cover the lowlands, making the Irish Sean and the North Sea. The higher parts still remained above the water as islands while the sea ran far inland into lower valleys, making the many bays and harbors which mark the shore of the British Isles. The lower part of the Thames River is such a sunken valley, navigable to London. \u00a7 London Bridge is the most important bridge. It has been ascertained that each 24 hours an average of 170,000 persons and 20,000 vehicles cross this bridge. IT was built in 1831, of fine granite. It is 928 feet long, 54 feet wide, and is made up of 5 arches. The lamp posts were made from cannon, taken from the French in the Peninsular War. Modern London has grown up around this bridge.&quot;\n  \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 017\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
