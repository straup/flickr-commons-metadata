After receiving the waters of many small streams, at Orte, where it is joined by the Nera (the ancient Nar) it forms the boundary between Umbria and Rome, encircling Mount Soracte and entering the Campagna Romans. About three miles above Rome it is swelled by the Anio (now Ariene or Teverone) then passes through the city of Rome, where it forms an island, the Insula Tiberina (now Isola diSan Barolommeo) and enters the Tyrrhenian Sea about 26 miles below. \n\nThe Total length of the TIber is 245 miles; its breadth at Rome is about 250 feet. It is a swift-running stream, carrying down an enormous amount of alluvial matter, which, in solution, gives the water that yellowish color for which the Flavus Tiberis was renowned. The sediment deposited at the mouth of the Tiber is pushing out the land at the rate of about 10 feet a year, so that the ruins of Ostra, the ancient harbor of Rome, are now more than four miles inland. The delta is formed of two mouths, the fuimicino, originally a channel dug by Trajan for his harbo (Portus Traiani) now the larger and navigable branch, and the fuimara, now almost choked by sand banks; and these enclose the Isola Sacra, a desolate and unhealthful island once sacred to a Venus. The Tiber is navigable by small steamers as far as Rome and by smaller craft 60 miles higher up. It is subject to frequent and often disastrous inundations, of which the ancient writers have recorded no less than 23. Among the more famous floods are that mentioned by Horace, when the water at Rome rose 51 feet, and in 1900, when it reached a flood height of almost 54 feet. To remedy this evil the government, beginning in 1876, constructed massive embankments at Rome, at the expense of more than $25,000,000; but the carefully planned work has proved defective. The stream on the north of the Tiber island has become clogged with sand, and in the flood of 1900 fully a quarter of a mile of the south embankment was carried away by the water.&quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 019\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
