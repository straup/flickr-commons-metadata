Its basin, lying between the Himalalya and Vindhya ranges, is one of the finest and most fertile portions of the world, as well as one of the densest populated areas of the globe. The Ganges has its main source in a snow-field embedded between three Himalayan mountains over 22,000 feet high. Like all rivers subject to floods, the Ganges holds in suspension a large admixture of mud and sand, depositing in the sea annually millions of tons of solid matter. The delta, which in the northern part is fertile and well cultivated, in the south bordering the sea is a dismal network of swamp land, known as the Sundarbans, infested by crocodiles, tigers, and other wild animals.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 021\n\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
