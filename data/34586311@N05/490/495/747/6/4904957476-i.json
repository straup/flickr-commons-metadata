Rivers cannot cut even at their mouths, but a little below the level of the body into which they flow. The Jordan does not violate this law and yet a portion of its course is far below sea level. It rises west of Mt. Hermon and after spreading out into Lake Merom and the Sea of Galilee, discharges its waters into the Dead Sea, which has not outlet and is a body of salt water, and here the Jordan is below sea -level. The Valley of the Jordan, the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee occupy a portion of a long narrow depression in the surface of the earth. At the east and wast margins of the depression there are great fissures or breaks in the rocks and the land between these fissures has fallen or been drawn in toward the center of the earth.&quot;\n \n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 023\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
