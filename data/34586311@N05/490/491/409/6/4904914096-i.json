It rises on one side of Saint Gothard near the source of the Rhone and not far from the tunnel where the railroad goes through to Italy, about a mile and a half above the level of the sea. It is fed by many an ice-cold milk-white glacial stream as it dashes along down the Alps into the beautiful Lake Constance. It comes out of this placid bed only to take another tumble at Schaifhausen over the greatest falls of Europe, and then flows west to Basel into a fertile valley form 20 to 25 miles wide. To the west are the Vosgees Mountains and to the east the Black Forest. From Bingen it cuts a deep canyon through the central highland to Bonn, then losing its hold, it dies an ignoble death in the sands and silts of the Low countries of Holland and Belgium.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 020 014\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
