The men in the picture, reading from left to right, are: C.P. Bacon, Adolph Miller, Thomas J. Dryer (editor of The Oregonian at that time), W.H. Barnhart (in the doorway), H.W. Corbett, John M. Breck and W.S. Ogden. The dray was the first in Portland and, therefore, an object of considerable interest in those days. It was purchased in San Francisco by Mr. Barnhart for $400 and sold to Mr. Miller. The first building in the foreground is the general store of Breck &amp; Ogden. Just beyond it is the general store of W.H. Barnhart &amp; Co., part of which was occupied by the first Wells-Fargo Express office. The large building beyond was the store of H.W. Corbett. A vessel may be seen in the harbor at the end of the street.&quot;\n&quot;Historic Pictures Mark Progress of Pioneer Portland,&quot; Morning Oregonian, Feb. 4, 1911, p. 6", "authorname": "theseahawk", "id": "34580971-3640904265-72157635007104052", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "3640904265"}, "flarchive:created": 1389684624}
