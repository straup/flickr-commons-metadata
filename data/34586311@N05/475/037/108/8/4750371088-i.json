But, undoubtedly as wealth increases in the world, and our glove trotters tire of the more common and convenient places, New Zealand will attract increasing numbers and eventually will become a great Mecca, particularly for the more hardy and appreciative of the tourists and adventurers. \n\nThe higher parts of the Southern Alps of New Zealand challenge caparison with the Alps of Switzerland, for although they fall short by two or three thousand feet, the lower snow-line of the New Zealand Alps more than compensates for their lesser altitude. \n\nMt. Cook, 12,350 feet, is the highest point not only in the Southern Alps, but in new Zealand. Its Maori name, Aorangi, means &quot;Cloud in the Heavens.&quot;&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 057\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
