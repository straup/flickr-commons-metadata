Rotorua is the railway terminus, and here are many hot springs, geysers, and mud baths. Lake Rotomohana, at the foot of the volcano of Tarawera, is actually boiling at that portion of its shore where formerly existed the 'Pink Terraces'. \n\nThis pumice-covered region was supposed to be infertile and supports only a useless 'manuka' vegetation, but it is now being brought under cultivation by scientific methods. \n\nThe natural wonders attract thousands of visitors.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 053\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
