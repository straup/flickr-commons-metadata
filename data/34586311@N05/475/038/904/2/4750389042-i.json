The East Australian highlands are made up of series of low mountain ranges that are heavily forested. The Great Dividing Range, the New England Range, and the Blue Mountains are included within this highland region.\n\nThe mineral resources and the water power of this region encourage mining and manufacturing, and have led to the great industrial development of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. \n\nMost of the white people of Australia live in this portion of the continent, and it is rapidly becoming more and more densely populated. \n\nThe Victorian Highlands extend in an east-and-west direction near the southern end of the East Australian Highland, and just south of the Victorian Highlands is the broad, rich valley of Victoria.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 004\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
