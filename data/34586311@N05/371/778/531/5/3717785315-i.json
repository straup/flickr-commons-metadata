More than half of this is in Oregon.\n\nOther important commercial woods in Oregon are Western white Pine.  Yellow Pine, hemlock, red cedar, and Sitka spruce.  In the southwestern part of the state Port Orford cedar stands to the amount of two billion feet.  In 1925, Oregon mills turned out ninety million feet of Port Orford cedar which is used largely for battery insulators, wings of aeroplanes, boats, furniture, etc.  The mills of the five states of the Pacific Northwest produced eight billion feet of lumber from Douglas fir in the same time\u201d\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 035 002\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
