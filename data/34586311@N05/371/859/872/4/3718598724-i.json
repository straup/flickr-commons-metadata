It was accepted by the state from the contractor on August 26, 1876.  Of course later additions were made to the building and this picture shows it as it is today after a half century of service.  During the fifty years the industrial growth of Oregon has been gradual until today, in proportion to population, the quantity and quality of the products of the state are very gratifying.\n\nThe lumber and timber products industry, including logging camps and sawmills, is the leader in manufacturing when measured either by value of products or the number of wage earners employed.\n\nThe basic industry of Agriculture continues to increase its production, in spite of the fact that there were about 8000 less farm owners in 1925 than in 1920.  While transportation companies in Oregon rank next to timber in the number of employees, the farms make possible the grain mills and flour mills, the output of which ranks next to timber products in value.\n\nStanding third in value in factory products is the slaughtering and meat packing industry, while butter-making flows closely and is steadily gaining in the value of its output.\n\nThe pictures following give glimpses indicative of a few industrial activities of Oregon.\u201d\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 035 001\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
