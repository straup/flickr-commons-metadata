It is the only continent except uninhabited Antarctica, which is entirely with the southern hemisphere. \n\nAustralia was the last grand division of the earth to be visited by Europeans. It was discovered by Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch navigators, but it was not thought to be of any value until Captain James Cook, the great English explorer, made a tour along the east coast. He brought back glowing reports of the richness of the country, and the English at once sent out and took possession of it. By and by colonies were established in the best parts of the country. they grew rapidly, and now there are white people living in all of the habitable regions. The continent is divided into five great colonies or states and one territory--South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the Norther Territory. &quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 001\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
