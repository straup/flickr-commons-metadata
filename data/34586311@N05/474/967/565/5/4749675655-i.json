It is situated at the lower end of Cook Strait, which is so windy that it has been called the Windpipe of the Pacific. Were it not for the excellent harbor, ships could not land and even as it is, great wooden docks have been built to protect them.\n\nWellington has good streets, fine public buildings, excellent stores, and comfortable houses. It is here that Parliament meets, and here live the chief officials of the country. New Zealand is a British colony, and as such it has a governor appointed by the Kind of England. The governor however, has not much power; the people make their own laws and elect those who execute them. In New Zealand every one votes, women as well as men. The telegraphs and railroads belong to the government, which does everything it can to help the people.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 025\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
