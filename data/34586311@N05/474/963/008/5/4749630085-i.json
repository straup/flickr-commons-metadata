Hemmed in by forested hills, with a clear mountain atmosphere and cool summer nights it has become one of hte great resting-places of the South. \n\nFerns are characteristic of New Zealand forest. Some, like our own, love the moist shady depths of deep gullies; some hang from crevices and drape the faces of cliffs with a film curtain; some- the tree ferns, have trunks as thick as trees, are so large that they must be hewn down with axes, and are often 50 feet high, with an umbrella like spread at the crown, of some 30 feet in diameter. They often form dense groves.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 016\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
