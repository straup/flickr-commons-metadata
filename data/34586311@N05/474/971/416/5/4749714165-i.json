It lies on an isthmus at the foot of Mount Eden, which is six hundred feet high;  it is not far from the mouth of the Waikato River, the chief stream of the archipelago. It is a great business city and port of call. It is the seat of the University, and has a fine museum, rich in Maori remains. The Public Library includes the valuable library of Sir George Grey. The surround bills are old volcanoes with fine craters, such as Mount Eden; the most recent in eruption was probably Rangitoto on an island in the gulf.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 040\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
