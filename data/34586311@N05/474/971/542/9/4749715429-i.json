Its ankle is as big around as my calf and its gray body is the size of small haystack. Its tall thin neck is stretched so high above its breast that Barnum's circus managers would have had a hard time getting the animal into a freight car. its legs are as strong as those of a camel and it looks quite as big as the biggest 'ship of the desert'. Its enormous feet have claws like those of a turkey, save that each is a foot long. I doubt not that the Moa could have stamped out the life of a man at one kick.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 039\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
