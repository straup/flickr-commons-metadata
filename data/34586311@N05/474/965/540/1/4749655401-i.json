This is the land of the marsupial or pouch bearer. There are more than one hundred different kinds of animals which have pouches on their bodies, in which they carry their young. Some of these animals are taller than a man, and some no bigger than your thumb. Some climb trees, and some gallop over the plains, and some spend more than half their time in the water. \n\nThe largest of the marsupials are the kangaroos, ranging in size from great gray fellows measuring more than seven feet from nose to tail down to the family dwarf, the kangaroo rat. \n\nThe red and gray kangaroos are hunted in most parts of Australia and killed by the thousands. Horses and dogs are bred for sport. The dogs are a sort of hound, very fierce and fleet of foot. The big kangaroo has enormous hind legs which send it flying along as though moved by steel springs. It can leap twenty to thirty feet at a jump, and it fairly gallops over the country.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 032\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
