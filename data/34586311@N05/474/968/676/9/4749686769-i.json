The plumage is very compact and usually dark-colored and glossy with greenish or bluish green reflections. the head is often crested and during the nesting season the head and neck are often ornamented with more or less conspicuous plumes of slender hair-like feathers which disappear after the breeding season is over. \n\nCormorants are sociable birds, often congregating in flocks of immense size. Some of the others make their home in inland swamps and marshes. they feed exclusively on fishes, which they are extremely dexterous in capturing.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 035\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
