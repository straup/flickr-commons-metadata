Naturalists tell us that the continent has more than seven hundred varieties of birds which are found nowhere else. There are vast numbers of parrots in the woods of the north, some as white as snow, others of a delicate pink, and others as red as fresh blood. There are yellow parrots, green parrots, and parrots of every shade and tint you could imagine.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 039 033\n \nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
