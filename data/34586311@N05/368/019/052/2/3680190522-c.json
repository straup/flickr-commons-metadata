In searching for the answer to your question, we actually found quite a deal of new information about some of these slides.  A number of these images were created by <a href=\"http://www.hockadaymuseum.org/Permanent Collection/kiser.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fred H. Kiser</a>, a prominent photographer of the time.  The <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3680181508/in/set-72157620692762157\">Crater Lake Lodge</a>, which was included in the same set of images as this Harp Rock image, <a href=\"http://www.craterlakeinstitute.com/cultural-history/structures/crater-lake-lodge.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">opened in 1915</a>, meaning that the image was not created any earlier than this.  Further, we do know that the majority of the lectures that accompany the Visual Instruction Slide series were written in 1920, which gives us an end date.  Although we can\u2019t be 100% sure, this particular photograph may be part of a series of \u201cnature scene\u201d photographs that Kiser created in 1917.\n\nSince this is probably much more information than you were looking, to sum it all up, Fred H. Kiser took this photograph between 1915 and 1920.
