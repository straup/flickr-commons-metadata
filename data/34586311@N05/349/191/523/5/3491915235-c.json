Symons, originally from New York, moved to Seattle at the age of fifteen. After a three-year apprenticeship to a jeweler, he worked in a Dawson, British Columbia, jewelry store for almost two years; while living in Dawson, he gained experience in scenic photography by photographing the Yukon. Symons returned to Seattle where he was married and opened his own jewelry store but moved to Bend, Oregon, in 1915. \n\n&quot;In Bend he established the first jewelry store in the O'Kane Hotel building and became known as a local photographer. Symons photographed sawmills, local businesses, the Cascade Mountains, and other areas of interest in central Oregon. In 1920, his brother Archie became a partner in the jewelry store. Myron's photographs were sold in booklets by the Symons Brothers jewelry store.&quot; <i>&ndash; <a href=\"http://www.lib.washington.edu/Specialcoll/findaids/docs/photosgraphics/PetersenRasmusPHColl652.xml\">University of Washington Libraries</a></i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "34580971-3491915235-72157617782767032", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3491915235"}, "flarchive:created": 1389684772}
