The islands have a combined area about the same as that of California, and a population more than half as large as that of the United States. \n\nThe Japanese belong to the yellow race. Like the Chinese, they were isolated, and developed a civilization very different from that of the white people in the Mediterranean region and western Europe. They lived chiefly as farmers, gardeners, and fishermen, and there in the midst of beautiful surroundings of wooded hills and snow-capped mountains rising above the grass and wild flowers of the lowlands, they became lovers of nature and a most artistic people. \n\nUntil the middle of the last century Japan was closed to all intercourse with the nations of the Western World. But in 1854 Commodore Perry of the United States Navy persuaded the Japanese to enter into relations with our country. This was the beginning of a remarkable change in Japan. Little by little the people took on some of the ways of Western civilization; modern methods of manufacture replaced primitive methods; more machinery was used; steel works were constructed; science was applied to agriculture and to industry; Japan became a great military and naval power. The Japanese began also to colonize the opposite mainland, and between 1894 and 1905 Japan fought first China and later Russia, finally obtaining possession of the peninsula of Chosen. &quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 060 001\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
