A Japanese never shows more than one picture or one set of pictures at a time. If he has a large collection, he keeps them in his fireproof storeroom, and gives to each in turn a temporary place in the alcove recess. As it hangs there the eye must find equal pleasure in regarding it from every part of the room.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 060 028\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
