Nothing can surpass--I would almost say, approach-- the spotlessness of a Japanese home of the better class, but you must think of a summer pavilion to get an idea of how a private house in Tokyo differs from an American or European house. It does not stand on the street, but backs from it behind a wall with a simple gate or gate and portico in the center. Then there is a house portico and an open door under it. Nowdays there is an electric bell to summon the servant, who appears on her knees with bowed head to take your message and your card. There are usually some flowers or greenery in front, but the garden is at the back. The house is built of wood on a brick or stone foundation, and its rooms through the use of sliding doors or &quot;fusumas&quot; may be opened.&quot;\n \nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n \nItem Number: P217:set 060 031\n \n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
