Of course, this is not accepted today, but it is easy to understand how such a legend was evolved. Our picture shows the Cascades at a period far below below the high water mark. The fall of the river through the Cascades is about 40 feet.&quot;\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 025 015\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
