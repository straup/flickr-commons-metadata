At no point is there a beach. The steep walls descend and plunge into the water. \n\nWhen Mt. Mazama collapsed leaving clean cut the edges which today are Crater Lake\u2019s surrounding cliffs, there was instantly a surging back. The crumbling lavas were forced again up the huge chimney. \n\nBut not all the way. The vent became jammed. In three spots only did the fires emerge again. The small volcanoes formed in the hollow. \n\nBut these in turn soon choked and cooled. During succeeding ages springs poured their waters into the vast cavity, and Crater Lake was born. Its rising waters covered two of the small volcanic cones. The third still emerges. It is called Wizard Island.&quot; \n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 065 010\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
