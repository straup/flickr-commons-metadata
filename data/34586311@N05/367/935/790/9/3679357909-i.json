His throne in the infinite depths of the blue green waters was surrounded by his warriors, giant crawfish able to lift great claws out of the water and seize too venturesome enemies on the cliff tops. \n\nWar broke out with Skell, the god of the neighboring Klamath Marshes. Skell was captured and his heart used for a ball by Llao\u2019s monsters. But an eagle, one of Skell\u2019s servant, captured it in its flight, and a deer, another of Skell\u2019s servants, escaped with it; and Skell\u2019s body grew again around his living heart. Once more he was powerful, and once more he waged war against the God of the Lake. \n\nThen Llao was captured; but he was not so fortunate. Upon the highest cliff his body was torn into fragments and cast into the lake, eaten by his own monsters under the belief that it was Skell\u2019s body. But when Llao\u2019s head was thrown in, the monsters recognized it and would not eat it. \n\nLlao\u2019s head will lies in the lake, and white men call it Wizard Island. And the cliff where Llao was torn to pieces if named Llao Rock.&quot;\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 065 019\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
