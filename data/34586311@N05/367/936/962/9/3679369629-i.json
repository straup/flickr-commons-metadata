Mazama \u2013 the deepest and bluest lake in the world. It measures two thousand feet in depth and the intensity of its color is almost unbelievable even while you look at it. \n\nMany Alpine lakes are blue under some lights. The deep blueness of Crater Lake may possibly be due to mineral which the water holds in solution; yet a glassful of the water is as clear as the clearest. Its cliffs from skyline to surface are a thousand feet high, and its color may be due in part to these surrounding walls and to its enormous depth. From the rim, a narrow margin of the water along the walls appears to be sea-green. \n\nThe lake has no visible inlet or outlet as it occupies the great cavity left by Mt. Mazama when it disappeared into its own depths. \n\nIt is a gem of wonderful color in a setting of pearly lavas relieved by patches of pine-green and snow-white\u2014a gem which varies in hue with every atmospheric change and every shift of light. \n\nBecause of the unique character and extraordinary beauty of this lake called by Joaquin Miller, 'The Sea of Silence,' Crater Lake National Park was established in 1902.&quot;\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 065 008\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
