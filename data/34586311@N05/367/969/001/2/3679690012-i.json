The story runs that two Indian chiefs wooed the same maiden who kept them both in suspense. Finally the two chiefs quarreled, each blaming the maiden's delay on the other. The quarrel grew so bitter that the gods took a hand in the matter, changed each chief into a rock a separated them by permitting the waters of the Columbia between them. The maiden also was punished by being transformed into the Horsetail Waterfall, 'ever escaping up the hill with her hair trailing behind, but never getting away.'&quot;\n\nOriginal Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides\n\nItem Number: P217:set 025 014\n\nYou can find this image by searching for the item number by clicking <a href=\"http://oregondigital.org/digcol\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n\nWant more?
