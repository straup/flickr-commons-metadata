Truck traffic also became more common on the highway. Eventually, a signal was installed at each entry of the tunnel, alternately allowing east and west, one-way traffic to avert collisions.&quot;\n\n&quot;By the 1930s, the tunnel was considered inadequate for modern traffic. A wider, river-level route (now designated U.S. Route 30) was built at the base of Mitchell Point around 1954. The five famous windows were bricked up, the tunnel filled with rock, and the viaducts leading to the tunnel were blocked.&quot;\n\n&quot;The once-celebrated tunnel remained abandoned, but intact, until 1966 when the Mitchell Point Tunnel was destroyed during the widening of Interstate 84.&quot;\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"http://www.columbiariverhighway.com/coppermine/thumbnails.php?cat=2&amp;album=search&amp;search=mitchells_point\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historic Columbia Highway site</a> for vintage postcards of the tunnel. \n\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/march02/briefings_tunnel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Washington's 2002 article in Columns Magazine</a> for information about the tunnel.", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3679690626-72157621830047887", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3679690626/#comment72157621902698265", "realname": "Rachit Vats", "path_alias": "fishinbowl", "author": "34640077@N05", "iconserver": "3121", "datecreate": "1250155521", "_content": "This looks very nice.", "authorname": "vatsup1", "id": "34580971-3679690626-72157621902698265", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3679690626/#comment72157622027522102", "realname": "Eivind Nilsen", "path_alias": "stickmeat", "author": "33769727@N06", "iconserver": "3104", "datecreate": "1250160212", "_content": "Nice shot!", "authorname": "stickmeat", "id": "34580971-3679690626-72157622027522102", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3679690626/#comment72157622051578804", "realname": "sundara soundappan", "path_alias": null, "author": "33163305@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1250408893", "_content": "angle of the shot is good", "authorname": "sundara53", "id": "34580971-3679690626-72157622051578804", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3679690626/#comment72157621953623417", "realname": "P.A.
