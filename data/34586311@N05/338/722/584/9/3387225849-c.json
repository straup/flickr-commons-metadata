When completed in 1936, it was widely regarded as one of the finest concrete bridges in America. Unfortunately, it suffered serious structural deterioration as a result of corrosion of its steel reinforcement. It was demolished in 1991.&quot;--<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/77136894@N00/303337955/\">Bridge Ink</a></i>\n\nThe beautiful new bridge, designed by HNTB, is shown in the first photograph. The 1991 photograph shows replacement construction of the new bridge beneath the old bridge. Construction of the replacement bridge began in 1988, and was completed in 1991.\n\nThe bottom two photographs show the historic bridge 30 years apart. The original bridge was completed in 1936 as a Public Works Project.\n\nTo begin to try to convey the beauty of this bridge and geography, I included an aerial photograph of Alsea Bay by Alex Derr.\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Alsea Bay Bridge (2008)&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; by <i>Martina</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/martina/2726654722/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3234/2726654722_c9f2ee0f41_m.jpg\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge 4\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge 4 by martina\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Alsea Bay Bridge (1991)&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;by <i>Dezotell</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31586784@N02/2961463031/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3240/2961463031_5322622f25_m.jpg\" alt=\"91xxxxOR Alsea Bay Bridge\" alt=\"91xxxxOR Alsea Bay Bridge by 31586784@N02\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Alsea Bay Bridge (1984)&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; by <i>BridgeInk</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/77136894@N00/303337955/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/122/303337955_045d55fa72_m.jpg\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge by 77136894@N00\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Alsea Bay Bridge (1954)&quot;&nbsp;by <i>Wanda Gifford</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3387225849/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3268/3387225849_bacbf82813_m.jpg\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge at Waldport, Oregon\" alt=\"Alsea Bay Bridge at Waldport, Oregon by osucommons\" /></a>\n\n______________________________________\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Alsea Bay (2007)&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by <i>Alex Derr</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex1derr/517377065/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/189/517377065_5070302949_m.jpg\" alt=\"Alsea Bay 4\" alt=\"Alsea Bay 4 by alex1derr\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/189/517377065_5070302949_b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>View large.</i>\n&nbsp;</a>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "34580971-3387225849-72157616783866387", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3387225849/#comment72157616888751428", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1239921941", "_content": "Beautiful shots!
