I love being able to see these.\n\nMy hope is that people will post pictures of these things today and we can link them through the comments.\nThey made so many wonderful things for us to enjoy.\nSo many of their projects are being lost, forgotten, rebuilt and destroyed. I feel an urgency to get people to seek out and photograph these bits of our history.\n\nThank You OSU Archives and Gerald W. Williams Collection\nFor posting all of these wonderful images for us to enjoy !!!!!!\n\n\nHi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1246153@N20/\">CCC, Civilian Conservation Corps Photos</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Mona Loldwoman (Look for the good)", "id": "34580971-3253659671-72157622826897884", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/osucommons/3253659671/#comment72157622831696592", "realname": "", "path_alias": "osucommons", "author": "34586311@N05", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1258580996", "_content": "You are quite welcome!", "authorname": "OSU Special Collections & Archives : Commons", "id": "34580971-3253659671-72157622831696592", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3253659671"}, "flarchive:created": 1389685381}
