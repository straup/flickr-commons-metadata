This was the church of my great grandfather Edmund Jones and his parents Thomas Jones &amp; Elizabeth Davies before Edmund and his brother Thomas emigrated to New Zealand in 1864. I only have a simple drawing of the church which records the church was &quot;pulled down in 1865&quot;. The new Llandyssil church was rebuilt down in the village however the Llandyssil Cemetery is still the old church burial grounds. On our travels to Montgomeryshire we sat on the cemetery stile with our thermos of tea to spend a little time with my ancestors.", "authorname": "no1kiwipat@yahoo.com", "id": "37154106-4171302077-72157628211262595", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4171302077"}}
