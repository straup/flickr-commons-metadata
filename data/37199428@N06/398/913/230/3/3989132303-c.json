Replaced later by Sketty School on Tycoch Road in 1909 (now awaiting a new use - hurry please Swansea City Council) and Parklands School, Sketty Park in the late 1960s.\nIt's now been converted into flats, more's the pity. I had a few snogs outside the Stewart Hall at discos in the '80s!", "authorname": "FritzFassbender", "id": "37154106-3989132303-72157623665649315", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3989132303"}}
