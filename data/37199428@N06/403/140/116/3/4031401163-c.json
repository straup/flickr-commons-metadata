Side parts in the hair usually means that the child was male, a part in the middle a girl - this rule holds up fairly well for most nineteenth century photos of children you will see. Otherwise there was often surprisingly (to us) little difference in the hairstyles and clothing of young children, regardless of gender. If the title is original to the photo then this image would offer an interesting counterexample (they do exist!) to this general rule.", "authorname": "LJMcK", "id": "37154106-4031401163-72157622805464790", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/llgc/4031401163/#comment72157622829806502", "realname": "Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru  / The National Library of Wales", "path_alias": "llgc", "author": "37199428@N06", "iconserver": "3564", "datecreate": "1258560516", "_content": "Hi LJMcK,\n\nMany thanks for your comment on the previous title (&quot;Three girls, daughters of Mr &amp; Mrs Charles Royd Smith&quot;). As this title was supplied by a cataloguer, and not taken from the original photograph, it has now been changed to reflect the information that you have supplied regarding children's hair-parting during this period. \n\nThank-you again for your valuable and interesting comment.
