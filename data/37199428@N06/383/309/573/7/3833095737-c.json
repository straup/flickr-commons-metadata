He was born on 7 July 1870, son of John and Margaret Jones of 19 Brook Street, Corwen.  Griffith married Jane Elizabeth Jones on 1 September 1900 and he built their marital home - Tirionfa, located behind the old school.  This photo is taken on the steps of his workshop at back of the house, and the second man is his employee.  Griffith was a devout Baptist and also did engineering work on Corwen's reservoir.  He died early - around 1927, and his widow lived on at Tirionfa until her 100th birthday in September 1970, when she moved to a care home.  She died in December 1971, and was for some time Corwen's oldest resident.", "authorname": "Morris Ancestors", "id": "37154106-3833095737-72157626288961415", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "3833095737"}}
