These quarrymen needed boots and shoes and several shoemakers and bootmakers moved to the village to supply that need. This photo may be of William Jones of 6 Rectory Street, as he is listed as being a shoemaker who employed 3 men. In 1881 William Jones was 45 years old.\n\nIs the photographer telling a story in this photo? On the right a shoemaker is holding the wooden mould of a shoe, in the centre a heel is being nailed on, and the shoemaker on the left is holding the finished boot.\n\nAnd there is not a last in sight, they are all working on the shoes in their laps.", "authorname": "Picture Esk", "id": "37154106-3743043744-72157622535427510", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/llgc/3743043744/#comment72157622634824260", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "36821100@N04", "iconserver": "3348", "datecreate": "1256157941", "_content": "Wow - very interesting - it must be a dying trade now...", "authorname": "Aristocrats-hat", "id": "37154106-3743043744-72157622634824260", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3743043744"}}
