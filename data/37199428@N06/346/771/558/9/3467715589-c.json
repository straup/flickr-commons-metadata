The women's skirts would have been longer pre-war and their waistbands haven't yet descended to the hips.  \n\nAlso it looks like the young man standing in Pugh's doorway is on crutches - although its hard to see even at the biggest size - if so, that would fit with the date estimate too.  \n\nI wish I could see this even bigger!
