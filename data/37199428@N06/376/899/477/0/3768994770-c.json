I'm glad you like the image. \nYou are right to say that this is a typical Welsh National Costume where a woman is dressed in a red or woven cloak over a white blouse and a striped flannel petticoat/skirt was worn under a flannel open-fronted betgwn or bedgown, with an apron and a tall black hat. \n\nThis type of outfit is one which has developed as a result of various influences which arose in the nineteenth century.  This type of costume was really the every day dress of the peasant, the farm servants and cottagers and was designed for hard wear. Others believe that the costume was developed as people felt that their Welsh national identity was under threat and therefore by wearing of a national costume, they were also declaring their identity.\n\nSadly, the Welsh costume is not often worn today and can only be seen in Welsh folk dancing parties, in the National Eisteddfod and most often on St Davids Day (Dewi Sant).\nThere are many more examples of these kind of costumes in the John Thomas collection at the National Library of Wales.
