I love the railway workers on the track - you can even see one of them holding some kind of wrench. The more important people seem to be standing on the platform near the train, but I can't quite pick out the station master among them. I love all the effort that went into setting this shot up - getting everyone together, parking the train up - and now, 124 years after it was shot, it's still as good a photo as the day it was taken.", "authorname": "Chris Turner Photography", "id": "37154106-3723236183-72157621919562480", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/llgc/3723236183/#comment72157621932104706", "realname": "Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru  / The National Library of Wales", "path_alias": "llgc", "author": "37199428@N06", "iconserver": "3564", "datecreate": "1249306196", "_content": "Hi,\nThank you for your comment. I agree  that it's a very strong image and it would be really interesting to know how John Thomas set up this shot.\n\nThis railway station was part of the Bala - Ffestiniog line through Wales, but the line was closed to passengers on 2 January 1960. The station building is now a private residence and the adjoining goods yard and military station site are in agricultural use.", "authorname": "LlGC ~ NLW", "id": "37154106-3723236183-72157621932104706", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3723236183"}}
