From a newspaper article in the Brisbane Courier from 13 December 1913:\n\nTERRIBLE ACCIDENT AT HARRISVILLE.\n\nA man named Charles Nutley, a resident of Normanby, met with a terrible death this morning. He had brought his dray into Harrisville loaded with chaff. While waiting there his horses were startled by something, and when the man tried to stop them the leader trod on his foot. This caused Nutley to fall or be dragged, to the ground, and a wheel passed over his head, crush- ing it almost to a pulp.

He was 40 years of age  and leaves a wife and three children.\n\nYou can read the article here:  <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19918791\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19918791</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-6999114657-72157629858269320", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6999114657"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620225}
