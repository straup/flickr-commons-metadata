(Description supplied with photograph.)\nThe lighthouse was built in 1874. During its lifetime it was shifted twice because of erosion, the last time being 1905. The lightkeeper's cottage also had to be shifted. This is how it appeared for the next fifty years. In 1954 the light was converted to gas automatic, unattended and the services of the lightkeeper were dispensed with. After considerable erosion the lighthouse was discontinued in October 1960. The channel is now marked using a buoy. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/4453\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/4453</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2311", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-10-20 13:51:40", "lastupdate": "1338675105", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1256010700"}, "originalsecret": "1afced1eaf", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2690", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4027768747/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389681366}
