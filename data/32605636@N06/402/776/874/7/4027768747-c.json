On October 1, 1902 Samuel James Reilly was appointed Lightkeeper at the Comboyuro Point Lighthouse on \u00a396 per year and remained there until his death on October 21, 1919, of a ruptured heart (making him the oldest lightkeeper in Australian history). Their children attended Bulwer school. During the 17 years at Comboyuro Point his son Harold (b 2 July 1893) was appointed Howard Range Lightkeeper (from 1 Jan 1913, aged 20); his other son George (b 20 June 1883) was lighthouse keeper at Lowe Island from Nov 8, 1909 then transferred to Piper Island Lightship on May 1, 1910 where he became Superintendent in Charge on May 1, 1912. He was subsequently posted to Point Archer on Nov 11, 1914. In 1914-1915 he was stationed at Archer Point, Cooktown. A third son - William Walter Reilly, known to me as &quot;Uncle Bill&quot; (b 28 July 1877) was appointed as deckhand on QGS Llewellyn and in March 1899 was transferred to become Lightkeeper for Mary River and Sandy Straits, and attendant on White Cliff light - but this seems to have lasted only until March 1900. He was taken on as master aboard QGS Cormorant from 1 July 1917, and later Mate on the QGS John Oxley. Lastly, his youngest son Cornelius &quot;Con&quot; Reilly (b 25 February 1896) enlisted in the Army on 15 May 1915, was wounded in Gallipoli and France in 1916. He returned to Australia in March 1919 seven months before his father's death.
