He was killed at Eglin air base in Florida in 1944 on a training mission. He was the first USAAF Ace of World War II. \n\nThe Distinguished Service Cross was awarded to First Lieutenant Boyd Wagner of the 17th Pursuit Squadron, Air Corps for extraordinary heroism in action in the Phillippine Islands on December 16, 1941. While leading a reconnaissance mission, Lieutenant Wagner left one plane of his formation above a hostile airfield to continue observation and with a companion dove through heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, to obtain vital information. Observing about 25 hostile airplanes on the landing strip, he dove directly on them, releasing six bombs and making several direct hits. In spite of being left unsupported due to the destruction of the accompanying airplane, he continued his attack, sweeping the hostile airplanes on the ground five times with machine gun fire and setting fire to the enemy's fuel supply before returning to report the accomplishment of his mission.\n\nView this page at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/189460\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/189460</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1266", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1942-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1373349319", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1287548982"}, "originalsecret": "81dbb433f7", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1373", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5098840328/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621301}
