The bride was given away by her uncle, Mr. Charles Blume, and she wore a parchment satin gown, shirred to fit the figure with a deep V neck inset with old lace, and a cape falling over the arms was also com- posed of the lace. Her veil was of parchment tulle, and she carried a sheaf of lily-of-the-Valley and white hyacinth, with a cluster of gold roses. The bride's sister, Miss Filmer Blume, as bridesmaid, wore a frock of turquoise blue georgette, showing flared half panels. She wore a tulle cap with a band of turquoise blue velvet flowers, and carried a bouquet of pink camellias, tied with blue velvet ribbons. Mr. Jack Lamb was best man.
