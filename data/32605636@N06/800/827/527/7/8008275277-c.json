Smith, Christmas Creek. The ceremony took place at the residence of. the bride's parents, the Rev. Father Enwright officiating. The bride was given away by her father, and was attired in a lovely gray costume, ornamented with liberty silk trimmings. An elaborately-embroidered bridal veil and a wreath completed the costume. The bride carried a bouquet of beautiful white flowers and maidenhair ferns. Miss H. Drynan, bridesmaid, wore a handsome pink costume with salmon-coloured trimmings. The bridegroom was attended by his cousin, Mr. M. F. Smith, as best man. The bride was the recipient of many useful and valuable presents. At the conclusion of the ceremony the happy pair and a large circle of relations sat down to the wedding dejeuner, where the usual felicitous toasts were proposed and honoured. Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Smith are spending the honeymoon at Southport.\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3670771\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3670771</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8008275277-72157631854548138", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8008275277/#comment72157631854561448", "realname": "State Library Queensland", "path_alias": "statelibraryqueensland", "author": "32605636@N06", "iconserver": "7441", "datecreate": "1351217966", "_content": "You can see the original newspaper article here:\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3670771\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3670771</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8008275277-72157631854561448", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8008275277/#comment72157634761766652", "realname": "Margaret Mckay-lowndes", "path_alias": null, "author": "99083724@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1374566845", "_content": "The reference to the wedding 'dejeuner' made me giggle.
