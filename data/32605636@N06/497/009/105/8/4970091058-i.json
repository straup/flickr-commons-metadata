Services were held in the old Court House in Alice Street until 1858 when a timber church was constructed on the site of the present stone building in Grafton Street. The Reverend Benjamin Glennie held Anglican services in Warwick as the Incumbent of Moreton Bay and the Darling Downs from 1860 until 1872.\n\nThe foundation stone of the present sandstone church was laid by Bishop Tuffnell on 19 March 1868. This stone building, which was erected between 1868 and 1872, consisted of a short nave, transepts, chancel and a small octagonal vestry in the corner of the chancel and southern transept. A broach spire surmounted the intersection of the nave of the church and the transepts and the roof was of timber shingles.\n \nIn 1938-9 substantial alterations were undertaken. These alterations, which were carried out in similar sandstone to that of the earlier building, included the flanking of the chancel with similar sized gabled structures, in the corners between the chancel and the transepts - one to serve as a vestry and the other as a chapel extension. The nave was extended at this time and the base of a tower was built at the western end of the building. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/130809\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/130809</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1111", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1939-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1335232879", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1283917645"}, "originalsecret": "393492caf1", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4146", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4970091058/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621683}
