The first stage of the building process was finished in 1910, and in 2004 the final stages are now being completed. The cathedral was originally to be placed on the Queen's Park site ( where the Pro Cathedral stood) but later changed to the current site in Ann Street, Brisbane.\n \nThe Deanery was erected in 1853 by John Petrie for Dr William Hobbs, and later altered as Governor Bowen's temporary residence. The Church of England later purchased the building and it became the Deanery. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/137644\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/137644</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1002", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1928-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1335233310", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1283917645"}, "originalsecret": "85fb32dd50", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4149", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4970091054/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621686}
