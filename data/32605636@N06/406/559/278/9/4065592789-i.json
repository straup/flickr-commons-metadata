Bernborough did his early racing in Toowoomba (QLD) but was to emerge from his humble beginnings to become one of Australia s greatest-ever racehorses, winning many of his races with a brilliant sprint from well back in the field. An unbeaten sequence of 15 wins included victories in the 1946 Newmarket Handicap (carrying 63 kgs) and the 1946 Doomben Cup (68.5 kgs). Bernborough s unbeaten run came to a controversial end when he ran a luckless fifth carrying 68 kgs in the Caulfield Cup. His racing career came to an end when he broke down at his next run, however he was retired to a successful career at stud in Kentucky (USA). He died in 1960. Career race record: 37 starts, 26 wins, 2 seconds, 1 third, 8 unplaced. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/67270\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/67270</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3448", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1943-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1370762152", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1257117017"}, "originalsecret": "1fdaa8e5a9", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "Great emotion", "author": "25573819@N00", "h": "207", "authorname": "Pablo Fonseca de Pinho", "w": "180", "y": "13", "x": "320", "id": "72157622976763332"}]}, "server": "2793", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4065592789/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389681211}
