Ravenswood developed as the first major mining town in north Queensland after the discovery of gold in 1868. It experienced the boom as a gold mining town and gradual but inevitable decline. This picture was taken at the time when Ravenswood's population was at its peak. Have you ever been to Ravenswood? We'd love to hear your stories and see your photos.", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8711503443-72157633428516058", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8711503443/#comment72157633414625995", "realname": "", "path_alias": "victor98", "author": "44191635@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1367817958", "_content": "great shot", "authorname": "victor98_2001", "id": "32560314-8711503443-72157633414625995", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8711503443"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618503}
