See image 127862. (Description supplied with photograph)\n\nThe Life Saving Guards were inaugurated by Mrs. General Booth on 17 November 1915 with the aim of providing enrichment for the body, mind and spirit of its members.\n\nThe uniform was grey and red. Brigades were divided into patrols and were under the direction of a Guard Leader. Each girl worked to become a second class and then a first class guard. After this there was a further honour to be achieved - the General's tassle. There were also a large number of badges which could be worked for such as First Aid, Athlete, Hostess etc and these were worn on the arm of the uniform. Guard troops met weekly and often included camping in their programmes.\n\nIn 1959 the Guards became Guides in the Girl Guide Association.
