This spectacular object is named after the wide, lagoon-shaped dust lane that crosses the glowing gas of the nebula.\n\nThis structure is prominent in wide-field images, but cannot be seen in this close-up. However the strange billowing shapes and sandy texture visible in this image make the Lagoon Nebula\u2019s watery name eerily appropriate from this viewpoint too.\n\nLocated four to five thousand light-years away, in the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer), Messier 8 is a huge region of star birth that stretches across one hundred light-years. Clouds of hydrogen gas are slowly collapsing to form new stars, whose bright ultraviolet rays then light up the surrounding gas in a distinctive shade of red.\n\nThe wispy tendrils and beach-like features of the nebula are not caused by the ebb and flow of tides, but rather by ultraviolet radiation\u2019s ability to erode and disperse the gas and dust into the distinctive shapes that we see.\n\nIn recent years astronomers probing the secrets of the Lagoon Nebula have found the first unambiguous proof that star formation by", "authorname": "\u062a\u064a\u0643\u0648 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644", "id": "32560314-4423447233-72157635180631016", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4423447233"}, "flarchive:created": 1389680900}
