(Description supplied with photograph.) The picture shows swimmers using the diving tower and springboard in the centre of the pool. Long wooden benches are arranged along the pool's edge for seating. \nThe first settler in the Manly area, Thomas Jones, built a mansion called Wyvernleigh. Wyvernleigh Plantation employed South Sea Islander servants in the house and on the plantation. The property is now called Tingalpa House. In 1899 when the railway opened, the area changed its name to Manly. Mary Louise Jones, Thomas' mother, was a first buyer of bayside land. In 1860 she acquired a large area south of Wynnum Creek which was later developed as the Waterloo Bay Estate. The area eventually changed from a farming district to a seaside resort and later to a residential district. In 1913 the area had a permanent population of only 200.( Information taken from: Queensland Place Names Board, Suburbs and Localities) \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/137547\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/137547</a>     \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/picture-queensland\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/picture-queensland</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1844", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1936-11-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1389319003", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1385005277"}, "originalsecret": "522ffe2061", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2860", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/10972090266/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389617875}
