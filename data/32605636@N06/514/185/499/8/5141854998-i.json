Jones' parents migrated to Australia in 1874 and settled forty miles north of Brisbane. Inigo was educated at Brisbane Grammar School. Clement Wragge, the Queensland Government Meteorologist, was so impressed by the boy's interest and ability that he recruited him as an observer. A few years later the family acquired a farm and settled at Beerwah naming their property 'Crohamhurst' after Lord Goschen's Surrey estate. Here Jones set up his meteorological station, which he maintained for almost sixty-six years. In 1923 Jones began issuing long-range weather forecasts for which he was to become famous. \nHe received financial aid from the Queensland Government and in 1934 built an observatory at Crohamhurst. Jones was elected a Fellow of the Astronomical Society in 1935. He died at Crohamhurst on 14 November 1954. His work was taken over by his chief assistant, Lennox Walker.
