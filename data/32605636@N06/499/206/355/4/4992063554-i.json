The organ and pulpit are visible from the nave of the church. Ingham is situated in the Herbert River district and is known as 'Australia's Sugar Bowl'.  Ingham derives its name from William Bairstow Ingham, owner of the Ings plantation, who settled in the district in 1873. \n\nThe town is positioned between a wilderness of parks, waterfalls and the waterways of the Hinchinbrook Channel, and is situated 110 km north of Townsville. Sugar-growing was established in the 1870s. The largest mills are the Macknade and the Victoria. Victoria Sugar Mill has the capacity to crush 4 million tonnes of cane. During the 1950s, sugar, timber-cutting and tin were responsible for much developmental work around Ingham. The port for Ingham is Lucinda Point at the mouth of the Herbert River. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/127613\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/127613</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1077", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1335228207", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1284518175"}, "originalsecret": "738d9813b9", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4154", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4992063554/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621599}
