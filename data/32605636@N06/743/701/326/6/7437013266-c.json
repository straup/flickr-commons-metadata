In the early days the wheels of the wagons were not made by a wheelwright but were blocks sawn from logs which were known as block wheels. All the pine logs were rolled in the river and rafted to their destination, this was at times rather an unpleasant job as owing to the two shallow places mentioned earlier the men had to turn out, in the winter, at night to catch the spring tide, which only occurred at night time at new moon. Much of the pine timber went to a small saw mill at a place known as Tygum on the Logan River opposite to the Waterford Railway Station which was owned by the late Lahey Bros. where they made their first start in the timber business and later built a saw mill at Canungra.\nIt was in the year of 1886 when the first Canungra Saw Mill was opened by the Lahey Bros. Another Saw Mill owned by the late Jesse Daniels at Cedar Creek commenced working at the same time and the year of 1896 was removed to Canungra. \nHistory of the Logan &amp; Albert Areas\n\nby Roger Hart 1959", "authorname": "Renira1", "id": "32560314-7437013266-72157631871857064", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "7437013266"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619745}
