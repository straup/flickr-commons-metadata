However, Mackay remained in possession of Greenmount for less than two years. Ownership transferred to James Starr in September 1864 and, despite Mackay\u2019s protests, he never succeeded in regaining control. Greenmount passed through a number of owners\u2019 hands before being bought by Albert A. Cook in 1913. In 1981 the Cook family gave Greenmount Homestead and its original contents and the land on which it is situated to Mackay City Council. The house is administered by the Mackay Historical Society and Mueseum Inc. and has recently undergone extensive renovations. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/100528\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/100528</a> \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "846", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1927-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1340756848", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1340572448"}, "originalsecret": "5d99b5fa2d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7129", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/7435206778/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389619798}
