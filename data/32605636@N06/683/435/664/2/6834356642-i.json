They named the low lying land they occupied Fortitude Valley after the ship which brought them to Australia. Within a few years they had established thriving farms and dairies. By the early 1850s the Valley had 150 houses and cottages as well as two hotels and one store. By the 1880s the area was densely settled, and in 1891 the train was extended to Fortitude Valley from the city. Up until the 1960s the Valley was a major retail centre, dominated by the department stores of T.C. Beirnes, McWhirters and Overells, which had all begun in the 1890s.\nThese firms dominated retailing outside the city centre for over half a century. In the latter part of the twentieth century population and business declined. However the rise in inner city living and the restaurant/nightclub scene has led to a resurgence of the Fortitude Valley area.
