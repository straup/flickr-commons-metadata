Ltd. driving an Autocarrier motor tricycle. Finney's, a large department store in Queen Street, Brisbane, was later taken over by David Jones. The Autocarrier, produced from 1904, was popular with delivery boys, being robust and simple to drive. It was powered by a 648 cc. single cylinder, air cooled engine.\n\nThe Autocarrier was the start of a long history for the English manufacturer, Autocars &amp;  Accessories Ltd., which went on to produce one of the fastest sports cars of the 1960s. In 1910 an odd looking passenger version of the Autocarrier was introduced, called the AC (from Auto Carrier) Sociable. The Autocarrier's delivery box was replaced with a buggy-like body where the driver and passenger sat side by side.\n\nFrom 1913 the company produced more conventional cars and in 1922 changed it's name to AC Cars and introduced an inline six-cylinder engine with an overhead camshaft. This engine powered increasingly fast AC sports cars until 1963. In 1962 American racing driver Carroll Shelby fitted a Ford V8 engine into a modified AC Ace sports car, to produce the blisteringly fast Shelby Cobra. With engines up to 7 litres and 500 horsepower, the light two seater Cobra could match the performance of any sports car of the time and and once again an AC was the 'dream vehicle' for many delivery boys. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/59425\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/59425</a> \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "440", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1905-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1363811202", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1331601906"}, "originalsecret": "0cbd41babd", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7061", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/6831761118/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620381}
