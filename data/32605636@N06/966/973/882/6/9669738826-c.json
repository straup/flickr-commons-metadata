Mt Ernest (near Mt Barney) was named after Ernest Hardgrave. I suspect the Rathdowney local history people might have a good deal of info on the family. Descendants still live down that way. My bet is that's his mother.\n\nFrom what I gather, Lindsay Hardgrave was evidently named after Mt Lindesay (which for many years was spelled 'Lindsay')...In the 1920s and 1930s climbers and hikers from Brisbane would often stay at the Hardgrave's farm during trips to Mt Barney and Mt Lindesay.
