Such dances are survivals of ancient dances around a living tree as part of spring rites to ensure fertility. Typically performed on May Day (May 1), they also occur at midsummer in Scandinavia and at other festivals elsewhere. They are widely distributed through Europe\u2014e.g., \u201cSellenger's Round\u201d in England, the baile del cord\u00f3n of Spain\u2014and also are found in India. Similar ribbon dances were performed in pre-Columbian Latin America and were later integrated into ritual dances of Hispanic origin. Maypoles may also appear in other ritual dances, as in the Basque ezpata dantza, or sword dance.\n\n&quot;Maypole dance.&quot; Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2009.
