From the article &quot;Moreton Bay Pile Light was a pile lighthouse positioned at the mouth of Brisbane River, in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, marking the entrance to the port of Brisbane. The light's early history was closely related to the dredging of the Brisbane River. It was established in 1884 as a result of a new channel that was cut, and relocated in 1913 due to another change in the channels. The structure was badly damaged by a barge in 1945 and finally destroyed when hit by a tanker in 1949. An automated light operated on the ruins until 1966\u20131967 when it was removed.&quot; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_Pile_Light\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_Pile_Light</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-7877941612-72157631310979000", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "7877941612"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619358}
