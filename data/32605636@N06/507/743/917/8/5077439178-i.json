He first attempted to grow cotton, then, convinced that sugar offered better prospects, he started cane-growing. By 1863, there were 20 acres under cane at Ormiston plantation and by January 1864, a mill building was under construction to house machinery manufactured by D. Cook &amp; Co. of Glasgow. Five men were required to conduct the crushing - three to haul up the cane, and two to feed it between the rollers. According to one historian 'the color and quality of the sugar produced were inferior and a crowbar had to be used to break the sugar in the crystallizers', but the effort brought Hope fame as the producer of the first commercial sugar in Queensland. In 1875, the mill was dismantled, after Hope lost a court case over a milling dispute. The mill's machinery was offered for sale in 1876. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9220\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9220</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1159", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-13 13:41:35", "lastupdate": "1334290304", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1286941295"}, "originalsecret": "6a61810ca6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4070", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5077439178/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621398}
