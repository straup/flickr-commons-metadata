Mrs Robertson was a registered nurse. Names of the children, not in order in the photograph, were Jack (eldest boy), Harry, Norman, Mary (who married Jeff Ross), Flore (Mrs Drake) and Marion (Mrs Trevethan). (Description supplied with photograph) \nStanthorpe is the commercial centre of the Granite Belt in Queensland. The region is unique for its wide seasonal variations, occasionally snowing in winter. The name Stanthorpe comes from the Latin word 'stannum', meaning tin, and the English word 'thorp' meaning village. The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.
