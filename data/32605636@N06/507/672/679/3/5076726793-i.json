However, Stanthorpe experienced a constant influx of tradesmen who needed their signs and delivery carts painted and they came to Messrs Gibbs and Emerick. (Description supplied with photograph). A baker's cart stands outside the building advertising C. Grant, Baker. The building is timber with a bark covered roof. \nStanthorpe is the commercial centre of the Granite Belt in Queensland. The region is unique for its wide seasonal variations, occasionally snowing in winter. The name Stanthorpe comes from the Latin word 'stannum', meaning tin, and the English word 'thorp' meaning village. The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.
