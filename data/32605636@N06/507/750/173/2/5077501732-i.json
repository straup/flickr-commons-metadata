In 1869, it was taken over by the Pioneer Floating Sugar Company and fitted up for the economical production of sugar and rum. It travelled up and down the Albert and Logan Rivers anchoring at wharves near the cane-fields. Its mill was made at the Queensland Foundry by Smellie and Company and was capable of crushing two tons of sugar a day and could make rum out of molasses. The Walrus ceased working as a distillery in 1871 because it was difficult to police and the Chiel Inspector of Distilleries was not in favour of continuing its licence. In 1873 it was retired completely because of the high cost of its operation. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/94894\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/94894</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1268", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1870-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1387117049", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1286943015"}, "originalsecret": "59e17d35c6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4039", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5077501732/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621360}
