On 5 January 1905, two years after the formation of the Queensland Women's Electoral League, the Electoral Franchise Bill was introduced into the Legislative Assembly to give the women of Queensland the right to vote. The Elections Acts Amendment Bill providing the necessary machinery, was introduced at the same time. Despite some misgivings about abolishing the plural vote, and difficulty with postal voting, these issues were overcome and the legislation giving the women of Queensland the right to vote was finally passed. It was assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor on 26 January 1905. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/88292\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/88292</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a> "}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1537", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1907-05-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1335630654", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1327387468"}, "originalsecret": "b10525dce3", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7145", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/6753538949/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620655}
