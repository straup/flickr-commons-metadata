He was wounded on the 3rd of last September in France, and the only information I can get from the Australian Military Headquarters is that he was wounded. But to what hospital he was taken they do not know.\n\nWhen in Egypt my son was very ill from\n\nthe heat and suffered very much with his head, and I fear that perhaps his head or sight has been affected, or he may be suffering from a lapse of memory as I have not heard from him.\n\nI am told again and again both from Headquarters and those who were with him that he was wounded.\n\nI know how difficult it is for you to find our boys, as there are so many hospitals in private houses. I believe there has been a large one given over for that purpose in the Kensington District, I do not know the name of the house, but I have a feeling that it being almost in London itself that my boy may be there. You may perhaps smile and think me foolish, but please could you humour me and see if he is there, I have been seeking him for all but six months.\n\nHis name is Eric J. T. Foote, No.3340. I have been told especially about this hospital, and it is the largest private house given up for that purpose in the Kensington District. Oh! If you will only look for me, and help me. I am willing to pay you for any expense or extra trouble which it may cause you.\n\nI am enclosing a photo \u2013 it may possibly help you \u2013 he is just 26 years of age \u2013 please tell him his mother wants him, and to think of her waiting for him. How shall I thank you for your help and goodness, for I am sure you will do so.\n\nBelieve me to be\nYours faithfully Violet Foote\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.adoptadigger.org/find-a-digger/article/1-diggers-database/47-foote-eric-joseph-trestrail\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.adoptadigger.org/find-a-digger/article/1-diggers-data...</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8513887865-72157632879015406", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8513887865/#comment72157632874885067", "realname": "State Library Queensland", "path_alias": "statelibraryqueensland", "author": "32605636@N06", "iconserver": "7441", "datecreate": "1362023557", "_content": "You can also see the documentation from the Australian Red Cross Society Wounded and Missing Enquiry Bureau Files 1914-18 War regarding Sergent Eric Joseph Trestrail Foote here: <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/1drl0428/2/108/7/1drl-0428-2-108-7-8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/1drl0428/2/108/7/1drl-0...</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8513887865-72157632874885067", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8513887865/#comment72157632879046740", "realname": "State Library Queensland", "path_alias": "statelibraryqueensland", "author": "32605636@N06", "iconserver": "7441", "datecreate": "1362023630", "_content": "And a portrait of him in his uniform from the Australian War Memorial <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/H06538/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au/collection/H06538/</a>", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-8513887865-72157632879046740", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8513887865/#comment72157632883887204", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "42400804@N05", "iconserver": "2534", "datecreate": "1362081427", "_content": "and what was the outcome?  do I want to know?", "authorname": "Renira1", "id": "32560314-8513887865-72157632883887204", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8513887865/#comment72157632889052010", "realname": "Andrew Douglass", "path_alias": "uuca", "author": "7532678@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1362145137", "_content": "I'm sorry, it's not a happy ending.
