It replaced the Albert Railway Bridge which was washed away in the 1893 flood. The bridge was designed by Henry Charles Stanley, Chief Engineer of Railways, and at the time was the largest bridge in Australia which was wholly of local manufacture. The bridge consisted of two steel spans, supported on abutments of masonry and a central concrete pier encased in an iron caisson to low water mark and then built up with masonry to the bearings of the girders. Each span was 10.3 m long and each weighed about 610 tonnes. A neatly designed footway was carried on the bridge's upstream side. Stanley's bridge is still in use today although it has been supplemented with an adjacent bridge to cope with increased traffic. [Information taken from: Janet Hogan, Living history of Brisbane, 1982]\nImage shows a view through the bridge with the stone pylons at one end. The railway tracks are clearly visible. \n\nView this page at the State Library of Queensland <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/129079\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/129079</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2026", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-10-07 14:00:40", "lastupdate": "1373897397", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1254888040"}, "originalsecret": "cb676ca924", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3513", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/3988612887/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389681427}
