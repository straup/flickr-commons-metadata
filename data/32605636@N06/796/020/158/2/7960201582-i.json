Constructed between May 1828 and December 1829 during the regime of Captain Patrick Logan, Commandant of the Moreton Bay penal settlement, the Commissariat Store is of Georgian design with freestone walls. In 1886 a single-storey brick building was added to the south-east wing, with a second storey being completed in 1900, though the entire wing was later demolished. In 1912-1913 a third storey was added to the entire existing structure.\n\nWhen first completed, the Commissariat Store was contiguous to a wharf and crane for the convenient unloading of docked vessels. After fulfilling this role the building was used to house immigrants, as offices for the Queensland Law Reform Commission and as a repository for Queensland State Archives. Fittingly, the Commissariat Store now serves as the headquarters of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland.
