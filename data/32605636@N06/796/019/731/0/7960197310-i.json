In 1883 a design competition for a two-storeyed building was won by Melbourne architects Grainger and D'Ebro. However this design was never used as the Queensland Colonial Architect, John James Clark, argued that the site warranted a four-storeyed complex. Clark's own design, entered in the competition prior to his appointment, was used. When completed in September 1889, the new building was occupied by the Premier, Colonial secretary, Registrar-General, Treasury, Mines, Works, Police and Auditor-General.\n\n\nStage two which completed the Elizabeth Street section was commenced almost immediately and was completed by February 1893. This new wing was occupied by the Registrar of Titles, Justice, Works, Public Instruction and the State Savings Bank. Work on the third state commenced in 1922 and officially opened in 1928, providing expanded accommodation for the existing tenants. The building is now home to an international casino and restaurants. \n\nView this page at the State Library of Queensland  <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/67261\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/67261</a> \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/picture-queensland\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/picture-queensland</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1056", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1914-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382574254", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1347166909"}, "originalsecret": "44968af596", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8041", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/7960197310/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389619166}
