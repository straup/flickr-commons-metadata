You may recall having seen this particular icon, but honestly, just how often? Why so infrequently?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3640355880/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3640355880/</a>\n\nThe Minerval aspect of Brigid accounts for or at least informs many of the bits of lore we have from the Irish and the Scots. The protectress function not only sees her as a guide and guardian of armies and nations but figures equally well in her inspiration to mothers and house keepers as foster mother, blesser of the home-hearth and protector of door, wall and roof. As inspiratrix she guides the creative with her flame of wisdom. As the emblem of the soul of the nation of Ireland to this day and more anciently of Britain, there is little question of her function as a goddess of sovereignty.", "authorname": "mikescottnz", "id": "32560314-6504265369-72157629159755302", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6504265369"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620912}
