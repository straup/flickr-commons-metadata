Grandad took photos in France, Wiltshire, Middlesex, and on the ship (TSS Wiltshire) home. Also, around Moreton Bay in 1919-1920 to show Grandma what she was coming to. Some prints he sent to Grandma and she brought them out with her after they were married in 1920. So, sometimes I am lucky in that I have the negative, a print, and an annotated print that has been sent to 'the girlfriend'. Grandma also took photos of her family in Middlesex and Devon, but they are far less well documented. \n\nMy intention is to, eventually, donate the negatives to the State Library once I can confidently identify and locate them all on a map. I will send you a flickr mail showing you where you can find some of these photos on the internet. I do have a few in my flickr photostream. \n\nI just had a 'win' this morning, as Swindon Museum helped me locate one batch of photographs.
