A. Cavanaugh, General Sales Manager of General Motors Holden. This first Holden was called the 48/215, but later became better known as the FX. It was powered by a six cylinder, 2.2 litre 'Grey Motor' driving through a three-speed column shift transmission.  \n\nSir Laurence Hartnett had worked on the idea of an all-Australian car since 1936, as Managing Director of General Motors - Holden, although he had left GMH by the time the first Holden was released. He then developed the idea of manufacturing a smaller, cheaper car in Australia, which was to become the ill-fated Hartnett. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/109521\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/109521</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2730", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-05-03 11:16:51", "lastupdate": "1382140313", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1304385411"}, "originalsecret": "62f706d410", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5228", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5682302788/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621092}
