Only a limited number of the prints were available.\n \nSt. Stephen's Roman Catholic Cathedral is situated in Elizabeth Street, Brisbane. The first Catholic Chapel was built in Brisbane around 1843-1844, and this was the immediate predecessor of St. Stephen's Church, designed by A. Welby Pugin, the greatest exponent of Gothic architecture of his time. The architectural features of Pugin's church, which still stands, is shown in the etching alongside the Cathedral.\n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/192634\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/192634</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1032", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-08 13:10:23", "lastupdate": "1336788001", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1283915423"}, "originalsecret": "d90d299749", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4105", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4969995440/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621727}
