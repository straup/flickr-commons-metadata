In 1877 both brothers selected land there. Mary Jane Pollock married Edmund Ford Curtis in 1878 and produced 11 children. It is likely that Margaret Pollock lived with her daughter on the mountain, as the titles searches indicate Tamborine Mountain as her place of residence. The Curtis brothers erected the waterwheel on Cedar Creek in 1888.&quot;", "authorname": "Renira1", "id": "32560314-4939080515-72157625653338522", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4939080515"}, "flarchive:created": 1389683162}
