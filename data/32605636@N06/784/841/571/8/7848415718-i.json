These portraits of Chinese diggers are entitled &quot;Starting for work&quot; and &quot;Taking it easy&quot;. The large number of Chinese miners aroused considerable resentment at times among other miners, and gave rise to riots in which the Chinese were driven from the goldfields. These disturbances were worst in Victoria and New South Wales ... In Queensland the largest number of Chinese miners were on the Palmer River in the 1870's when over 25,000 were on the field. The Chinese worked alluvial deposits rather than reefs, often reworking ground abandoned by other miners.
