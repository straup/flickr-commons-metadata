It was numbered 3 of the Great Northern (later Central) Railway. In 1882 it was shipped to Brisbane, becoming 2nd no. 3 of the Southern and Western Railway. In 1901 it was sent north to shunt Bowen Wharf. It was returned to Brisbane in 1913, where it was exhibited in Albert Square for the Queensland Government Railways 50th Anniversary of turning the first sod. It was then stored at Ipswich until 1936, when it ran under its own steam at the Railway Pageant. It was then preserved under cover at the Roma Street Railway Yards complex until it was removed to Ipswich Workshops in 1959. It is now displayed in Queens Park, Ipswich.\n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/140678\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/140678</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1813", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-06-25 11:27:12", "lastupdate": "1379360452", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1277429232"}, "originalsecret": "e0b4c10d25", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1014", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/4731334903/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389683414}
