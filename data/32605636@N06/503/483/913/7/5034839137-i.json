The structure also was used as a place of worship. \nOne teacher was employed to teach 58 children. He was reported to be 'painstaking and conscientious', but the level of attainment was regarded as very low, caused by the irregular attendance. Among the subjects offered, geography, writing and spelling were regarded as 'especially imperfect'. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9452\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9452</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1519", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-29 14:22:19", "lastupdate": "1372589164", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285734139"}, "originalsecret": "f5472fa179", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4131", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5034839137/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621444}
