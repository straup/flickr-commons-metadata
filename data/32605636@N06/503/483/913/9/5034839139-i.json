The exterior was distinguished by white Doric columns of local cedar and imposing cedar shutters, and the property was surrounded by a garden featuring water fountains and exotic plants, banks of camellias, and azaleas purchased at a cost of two thousand pounds. Louis Hope and his family lived at Ormiston for twenty years, until a legal dispute with a neighbour over crushing of cane resulted in a large financial loss. The house (and much of its furniture) was left in the care on an overseer and Hope returned to England. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9455\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9455</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1497", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-29 14:22:19", "lastupdate": "1334294769", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285734139"}, "originalsecret": "92ed5ff134", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4109", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5034839139/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621442}
