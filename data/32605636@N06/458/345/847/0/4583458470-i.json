The steam powered Locomobile was manufactured in the USA between 1899 and 1903. James Trackson was a pioneer of Queensland motoring, and imported this car, quoted in many sources to be the first car in Queensland. Mr Trackson's steam car was reportedly not popular with the authorities, who applied the by-laws on the running of steam rollers to his car, requiring a man to walk ahead of it with a red flag. This may have been the reason for his visit to the Governor!
