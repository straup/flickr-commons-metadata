After crossing Spain, the Middle East and India, Gilbert arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, and on 13 September 1897 began the walk from Albany to Adelaide. However on the second morning he awoke to find that he had been drugged and all of his possessions stolen. Gilbert made it back to Albany to restart his attempt a month after this first departure.\n\nGilbert walked across the Nullabor Plain being generously assisted by farmers along the way. After making his way to Moreton Bay on foot all knowledge of Gilbert was lost. Gilbert's diary covering the Australian part of his journey is held in the John Oxley Library.
