The following year, having changed her name to Mary, she appeared in The Flying Doctor (1936), an international co-production shot in Australia by the British director Miles Mander, and starring the imported American actor Charles Farrell. Maguire then left for Hollywood , where she debuted in the Warner Bros picture That Man's Here Again (1937).\nShe went on to appear in a handful of further Hollywood B pictures, including Alcatraz Island (1937) and Sergeant Murphy (1938), in which she played the love interest of a young Ronald Reagan. After Mysterious Mr Moto (1938) she moved to Britain and made a string of films there, including Keep Smiling (1939) with Gracie Fields, the aptly named Black Eyes (1939) and This was Paris (1942).
