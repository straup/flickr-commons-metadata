Boyd was one of the principal sugar-farmers on the Albert River, with four hectares of cane under cultivation at the time of this photograph. He erected his horse-powered mill around 1869. It would have cost between 90 and 300 pounds, and was capable of turning out a maximum of about 1,800 gallons of juice a day. The first reference to Ormeau Plantation occurs in the 1871 Census, when it was recorded that 15 people were living there. By March 1873, the whole of the property was up for sale (including the sugar machinery) as Boyd prepared to leave the Colony. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9208\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9208</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1660", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-22 14:03:05", "lastupdate": "1375443364", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285128185"}, "originalsecret": "7c506dd484", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4133", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5013319919/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621505}
