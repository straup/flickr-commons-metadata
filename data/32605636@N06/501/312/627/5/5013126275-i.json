This is an early example of the use of an interesting architectural element, which became popular in the 1880's. The decorative fretwork pediment installed over the doorway would have been manufactured by a professional joiner and was executed, probably at some expense, with a steam-powered fretsaw. The galvanised iron on the verandah awning was also an innovation that would eventually become Queensland's most popular roofing material. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9467\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9467</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1140", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-22 12:41:27", "lastupdate": "1335223730", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285123287"}, "originalsecret": "f009c0beb4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4128", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5013126275/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621548}
