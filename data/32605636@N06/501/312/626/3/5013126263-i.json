This venue was used temporarily by the North Australian Lodge, when a new meeting place had to be found in 1872. The brethren left the Old Masonic Hall and later moved to the Town Hall, which became their new quarters. The North Australian Lodge was the first established in the Colony and derived its name from the hotel in Queen Street where its earliest meetings had taken place. John Petrie, Sir Charles Lilley and Ratcliffe Pring were foundation members of this distinguished group of freemasons. \n*Please note that this image is inverted. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9446\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9446</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1457", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-22 12:41:27", "lastupdate": "1335223432", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285123287"}, "originalsecret": "55fbf889a3", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4128", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5013126263/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621558}
