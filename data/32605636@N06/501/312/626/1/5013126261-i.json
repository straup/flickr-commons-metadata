It was located in Shore Street, across the road from Cassim's Hotel. In 1871, Cleveland's principal attractions were a good supply of salt air and fresh seafood, or as one satirical observer reported, 'people come down here to eat oysters and fresh fish...and (to) wash and be clean'. Accomodation included two public houses and board and lodging was to be had in 'almost every second humpy'. One eyesore was the Cleveland racecourse, located on the Government Reserve, which for a long time had been the favourite resort of pigs that were allowed to 'grub up' the turf in search of wild yams and other delicacies, leaving large holes which made the ground unsightly and dangerous. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9442\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9442</a> \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1640", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-22 12:41:26", "lastupdate": "1371671725", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285123286"}, "originalsecret": "7869e65d50", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4091", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5013126261/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621561}
