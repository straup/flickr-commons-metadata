E. J. Cooper of Yorkshire) and her four children. In 1865, Browne had selected land from Bingarabah Crossing to Talai Crossing on the Nerang River and the 1871 census showed that 11 people were living on the property. Browne may be the man at far left, dressed in riding clothes and carrying a sportsman\u2019s gun. Thomasine Browne is possibly the woman at right, wearing an impractically elegant velvet gown. If this identification is correct, then the third figure may be her son, Edward Cooper Jnr who later established Birribon at Nerang. The small shelters at far right were kennels for the gun-dogs.
