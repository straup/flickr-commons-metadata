It was located at the top end of Maryland street, next to the premises of H.C. Ransome, auctioneer. The hotel also housed a Cobb &amp; Co. office and was described as 'the most commodious in town'. William Henry Groom (1833-1901) was the first proprietor. He had been a baker's apprentice in England, before being sentenced to seven years' transportation for stealing. Arriving in New South Wales, he worked as a clerk and as a Miners' Committee delegate. In 1854, he was acquitted of gold stealing, only to be found guilty a year later of a similar charge. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9502\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/9502</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1123", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-09-22 13:24:33", "lastupdate": "1335224173", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1285125873"}, "originalsecret": "3def652d47", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4129", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/5013838828/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621528}
