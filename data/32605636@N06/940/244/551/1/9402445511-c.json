The Fitzroy Boating Club was formed in August, 1863 and a press regatta was rowed in May, 1805. The Fitzroy Rowing Club was formed on September 5, 1877, with a membership of 102. The inaugural regatta was held on May 24, 1878, with the principal event, the senior fours, being won by F. K. Ogg, S. W. Hartley, H. Salmon, and W. Sewell (stroke). Numerous regattas and races followed and the sport boomed. The Central Queensland Rowing Club was founded in 1882, and the Lakes Creek Rowing Club in 1894. In 1880, the Fitzroy Club was renamed the Rockhampton Rowing Club and regattas were held regularly twice a year.", "authorname": "State Library of Queensland, Australia", "id": "32560314-9402445511-72157634861515703", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/9402445511/#comment72157634869146876", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mobili", "author": "52257493@N00", "iconserver": "3700", "datecreate": "1375231952", "_content": "Looking at Google Earth, the building with the dome may be the Customs House, still standing today as a restaurant. <a href=\"http://www.customshouserockhampton.com.au/about-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.customshouserockhampton.com.au/about-us/</a>  What do you think?", "authorname": "Mobilus In Mobili", "id": "32560314-9402445511-72157634869146876", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/9402445511/#comment72157634862690791", "realname": "State Library Queensland", "path_alias": "statelibraryqueensland", "author": "32605636@N06", "iconserver": "7441", "datecreate": "1375232488", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mobili] We agree.
