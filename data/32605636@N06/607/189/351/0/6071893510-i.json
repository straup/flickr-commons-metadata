The Duke of Gloucester. A charming composition in the period, Louis XV, designed and built by Ed Rosenstengel. From an original watercolour drawing by Wilfred Morden.\n\nThe furniture includes carved wooden pieces: a wardrobe, bed, mirrored dressing table and stool, occasional chairs and a highboy.  \n\nEdmund Rosenstengel (1887-1962) was born in Toowoomba. He learnt his trade as a cabinet-maker apprenticed to the business of Rosenstengel &amp; Kleimeyer. He was later to work in Sydney, Auckland, Vancouver and Grand Rapids (USA), as well as in England and Europe, before returning to Toowoomba in 1911.\n\nIn 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. \n\nHis best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York. (Information taken from: K. Fahy and A. Simpson, Australian furniture: Pictorial history and dictionary 1788-1938, 1998.)  \n\nRosenstengel operated out of premises located at 524 Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley, from 1922 to 1958.\n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/10816\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/10816</a>\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3608", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-08-23 12:12:45", "lastupdate": "1382532281", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1314065565"}, "originalsecret": "8d0b4a825e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6188", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/6071893510/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621066}
