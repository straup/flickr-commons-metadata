Many mines in the Selwyn and Argylla Ranges were inaccessible to wheeled vehicles. Camels were sturdier than horses or bullocks and did not require an established track to follow. The teams were operated by Afghani drivers. Afghan camps in the Clocurry area existed at Coppermine Creek, where a mosque was situated, and at Duchess, Rosebud and Urquhart siding (Information taken from: P. Hardy, A short history of the Cloncurry district, 1983).\nThe camels in this image are heavily laden with large boxes. A station windmill can be seen in the background and a dog stands to the left. \n\nView this image at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/79649\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/79649</a> \n\nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: <a href=\"http://pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pictureqld.slq.qld.gov.au/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2700", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-09-12 10:25:52", "lastupdate": "1387436985", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1378945552"}, "originalsecret": "6555e15356", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5329", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/9725658555/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389617902}
