He took up Emerald End Station on the banks of the Barron River. Settlement in Atherton began with the development of a cedar logging camp known as Prior's Pocket. Atherton is the agricultural hub of the Atherton Tableland. Chinese market gardeners dominated the scene until the early 1900s. After the First World War, land was cleared for soldier settlement. The fertile volcanic soil is ideal for dairying and grazing and also produces peanuts, potatoes, avocados, maize and other grains. Lake Eacham and Lake Barrine are the larger crater lakes in the district. From Atherton via the Herberton Range, it is about 16 km to the historic tin-mining town of Herberton.
