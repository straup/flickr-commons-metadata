He was educated in Switzerland and obtained his knowledge of chemistry at the federal polytechnic school at Zurich. He travelled in Russia and for a period was chemist in a sugar-mill in Bohemia. Meeting Dr Mueller of Gayndah, Queensland, he decided to emigrate to Australia and arrived in Brisbane early in 1885. In the year 1887 he became chief chemist and mill manager for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Homebush, Mackay, and early in 1897 was appointed chemist in the Queensland department of agriculture. For about 35 years he advised the department on a multiplicity of problems relating to agriculture in Queensland, and drafted many bills for the government relating among other things to fertilizers, stock foods, pure seeds and the destruction of pests. He also made scientific investigations into the prickly pear problem, the use of dipping fluids, and the provision of phosphatic licks for stock. He did valuable pioneer work in his studies of pasture composition and set a high standard in the work of his department. Generally he was a strong influence in the development of applied chemistry during his time. He retired from the agriculture department in September 1931 and died on 3 July 1933. He married in 1886 Kate Terry, who survived him with two sons and three daughters. He was elected a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry in 1905. \n\n--\n<i><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/\">Seen on your photo stream.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>", "authorname": "Brenda Anderson", "id": "32560314-3230471951-72157613095755463", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/3230471951/#comment72157613170299466", "realname": "Adrian Fine", "path_alias": "whatisleft", "author": "49689665@N00", "iconserver": "52", "datecreate": "1233363211", "_content": "Thanks for the story and the picture.
