It was described in 1919 by Sir Matthew Nation, former Governor of Queensland, as 'a pretty district of hills and dells'. The suburb was first settled in 1860 when Mr H C Rawnsley purchased land south of Witton Creek and in 1861 built the first house in the area, named Witton Manor, on the site of the present Nudgee Junior College. Development was slow until 1875 when a rail service was provided from Brisbane, after which houses and firms soon sprang up. In 1876 the first railway bridge was built. This was swept away in the disastrous 1893 flood, but was rebuilt. The Walter Taylor Bridge (commonly known as the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge) was built in 1936 and linked Indooroopilly to Chelmer.
