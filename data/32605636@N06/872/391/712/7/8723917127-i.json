Mobsby had studied art and design at the South Kensington School of Arts and at the School of Art, Brighton. He had diplomas and certificates from the London Chamber of Commerce, the City and Guilds Institute, the Cripplegate Institute and the South Kensington School of Arts. Mobsby was an instructor in Decoration and Photography at the Brisbane Technical College before being appointed artist and photographer with the Department of Agriculture and Stock in 1897.\nIn 1899, he was also appointed to the Chief Secretary's Department and the Intelligence and Tourist Bureau. Mobsby's photography gained international distinction and he officially represented Queensland at the Franco-British Exhibition in London in 1908, the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 (where he took a motion picture certificate course), the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924-25, and the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin in 1925-26. Mobsby gave many lectures on Queensland, its history, products, scenery, buildings, etc., illustrated by lantern slides. He also made a number of radio broadcasts in the 1920s. He retired in 1930, and died on 9 April 1933 at his home at 100 Station Road, Indooroopilly. He is buried in Toowong Cemetery.\n(Information taken from: University of Queensland Internet Database 2005, retrieved 6 September 2004, from <a href=\"http://library.uq.edu.au/record=b2051828\" rel=\"nofollow\">library.uq.edu.au/record=b2051828</a>\n\nView this photo at the State Library of Queensland: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/7887\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.handle.net/10462/deriv/7887</a> \nInformation about State Library of Queensland\u2019s collection: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/picture-queensland&quot; "}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2120", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1905-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1378412128", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1368148431"}, "originalsecret": "296f165d43", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7457", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/8723917127/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389618495}
