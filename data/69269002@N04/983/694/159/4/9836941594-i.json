It's said that due to business failure multiple times on De Silva's part, the house was never fully furbished or decorated. Though very unique in its Greco-regency neo-classical architectural design, the architect is still unknown, though assumed to be John Felix Matthews."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2284", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1880-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382586870", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1379686279"}, "originalsecret": "c0bd19a3cc", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2882", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/royalaustralianhistoricalsociety/9836941594/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
