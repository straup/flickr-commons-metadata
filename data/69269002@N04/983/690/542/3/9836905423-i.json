The gates were relocated to Macquarie St during the Cahill Expressway's construction in 1959-62. The original Fig Tree Avenue entrance is now known as the Woolloomooloo Gates. The fountain itself was built in 1866, it was designed as a drinking fountain. It was made of terracotta and stone and was the only drinking fountain in the Domain. It was destroyed during the construction of the Cahill Expressway.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Wishing Tree by Edwin Wilson, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst NSW, 1992, pp. 38-39 &amp; 125.
