Dr. Ward arrived in Sydney in 1852 as a surgeon superintendent on the ship the David M'Ivor. Ward was known around the area as an incredibly eccentric man, who was active in the local council, school of arts and church community. The house itself was demolished in the 1970's. Dr Ward was a keen amateur photographer and mainly took photos of local areas. \n\nSources:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/files/cad48e72-1a39-4ef9-9617-a15d00cd8853/All_the_conveniences_of_the_town.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/files/cad48e72-1a39-4ef9-9617-...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.daao.org.au/bio/robert-dalzell-ward/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.daao.org.au/bio/robert-dalzell-ward/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1879", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1860-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382586176", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1379685877"}, "originalsecret": "93d71a9c4e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3686", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/royalaustralianhistoricalsociety/9836839684/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
