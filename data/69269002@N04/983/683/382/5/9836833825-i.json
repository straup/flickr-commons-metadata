This ship, later replaced by the Sobraon, served as all boy public industrial schools and reformatories whilst moored in Sydney Harbour. Boys under the age of 16 were sent to these schools until they were old enough to enter into an apprenticeship or until 18 years of age. These schools were designed to give them a practical education, as well as an education in religious studies and morals, elementary schooling and nautical training. The photograph features the boys learning the skill of sewing.\n\nSources:\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.ancestry.com/au/2011/03/03/entrance-books-for-the-vernon-and-the-sobraon-1867-1911/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.ancestry.com/au/2011/03/03/entrance-books-for-the-v...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2038", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1869-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382585427", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1379685728"}, "originalsecret": "265c20d313", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3834", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/royalaustralianhistoricalsociety/9836833825/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
