Photolithography is the process of transferring geometrical shapes onto a mask of the surface of a silicone wafer. Renowned for his own take on the lithographic process created by J.W. Osbourne, Sharkey was promoted to manager of the NSW Government Printing Office's photolithographic branch in 1869. This particular image is an example of the correct way to use letters and lines that would be most suitable for a lithographical print as seen fit by Sharkey. \n\nSource: \n\n<a href=\"http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/vc/theory/photolith.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/vc/theory/photolith.html</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1712", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1869-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382585399", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1379685695"}, "originalsecret": "e2d1a6f4f4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7421", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/royalaustralianhistoricalsociety/9836912983/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
