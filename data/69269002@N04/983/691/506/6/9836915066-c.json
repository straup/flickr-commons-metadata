Bill won prizes for photos submitted,  including some of Bungarribee/Eastern Creek.  The close-up of the tower from March 1957,  helps date surviving colour slides from his various trips to the old homestead.  Within two months,  the house was demolished.  The distant shot (from south) was part of a collection used in the architectural study of 1950,  by tech students J. R. Kell,  M. P. Kitson,  W. M. Mathews,  J. W. Newman and C. V. Sylvester-Booth.
