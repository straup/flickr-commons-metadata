Convict labour undoubtedly, but the splendid nature of the undertaking, the mathematically correct angles of the walls, almost as smooth as brickwork, cannot but evoke admiration from even the most hypercritical spectator.&quot; - Frank Walker\n\nThe building in question is now known as Rosedale, and is a prominent landmark in Little Hartley in the Blue Mountains. The building was originally licensed as the Coaches and Horses, but the name was changed to the Victoria inn at a later date. W.J. Berghofer acquired the building in 1903, where it was renamed Rosenthal, giving the origins of the modern day name for the mansion. The building is listed with the national trust. \n\nThis image is part of a collection entitled \u2018Early Australian Architecture', which is available to view on the Royal Australian Historical Society's Historypin Channel.
