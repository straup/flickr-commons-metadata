Created by damming the Cordeaux River, construction started in 1918 and was completed in 1926. \n\n\nThe wall was built using cyclopean masonry \u2013 sandstone blocks, quarried from the site, fitted into an irregular pattern and packed with sandstone concrete. \n\n\nCordeaux is a curved dam with an unlined spillway to the left of the dam wall. Cement and metal were transported to the site from the main southern railway 21 kilometres away using a five kilometre steam operated aerial ropeway built across the Nepean Gorge. The final journey was completed by a narrow gauge rail line. \n\n\nA township for workers was constructed, with barracks for single men and small cottages for married men. \n\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.sca.nsw.gov.au/water/visit/cordeaux-dam\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sca.nsw.gov.au/water/visit/cordeaux-dam</a>\n\nThis image is part of a collection entitled \u2018Touring the Past - Tourism and History in Australia', which is available to view on the Royal Australian Historical Society's Historypin Channel.
