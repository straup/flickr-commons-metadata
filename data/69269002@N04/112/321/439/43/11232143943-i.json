Fine day, with a cool south wind. In the morning drove to the Cascades, one of the landing places. A stone jetty, reinforced with cement has been built here and a traveling crane is in course of completion. This is a very picturesque spot, and was originally used by whalers for landing and 'drying out' the blubber. Old boilers used at this time are still to be seen and the shore line is littered with decaying bones of great mammals, some of them being of gigantic size, apparently.&quot; \n\n- Journal of a Trip to Norfolk Island by Frank Walker, RAHS April 1917.\n\nThis image is part of a collection entitled 'Views of Norfolk Island', which is available to view on the Royal Australian Historical Society's Historypin Channel.
