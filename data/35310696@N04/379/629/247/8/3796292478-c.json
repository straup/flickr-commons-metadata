The mexico\u00b4s government didn't know about the existance of chichen Itza and all the archeological site until the same family, many years later, open it to public and charge a rate to the visitors for accessing.\nUntil the end of the XX century, those lands still was on hands of the same family, and they still were charging rates to visitors. \nThe castle was restored in a great way, excepting for one side of the stairs. That side of the castle remains destroyed until today. That's way we always see the same side of the castle on all the pictures.", "authorname": "Lonely Nightingale", "id": "35278557-3796292478-72157622065468297", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3796292478"}, "flarchive:created": 1389362132}
