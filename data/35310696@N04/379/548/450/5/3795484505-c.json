In fact, this photo shows a specific location in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The wall you see in the background is the wall build by the Spanish goverment to protect the island from attacks of possible enemies. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Puerto Rico was a very desirable territory for been a strategic point between the Old and the New World.\n\nFew years ago this place, where that man is standing up has been rebuild and been converted into a huge sidewalk where people can enjoy the view of the walls and the ocean sorrounded,  walking around the outside of the city. \n\nHere is how it looks in these days\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/30723207@N07/3030516523/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/3030516523_a8529193eb.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Paseo La Princesa.
