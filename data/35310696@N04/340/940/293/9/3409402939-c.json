Also, the high power lines run on the south bank of the I&amp;M canal, but they may have been moved.

Yes the photographer is still on the south bank.  He walked under the WSR bridge and shot this looking S/W .  Those electric supply lines are the wires running from the power plant down stream.  The Sanitary District was selling electric power to villages in those days.  The power lines run/ran between the ship canal and the I&amp;M back then.  There were poles along the south bank of the I&amp;M canal but those are long gone - though some of the stumps are still around.", "authorname": "sgt003", "id": "35278557-3409402939-72157638057498603", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3409402939"}, "flarchive:created": 1389364057}
