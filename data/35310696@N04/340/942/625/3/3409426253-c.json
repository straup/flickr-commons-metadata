If you loook at other buildings, there is nothing right up against the buildings, allowing the architecture to be viewed clearly from top to bottom.  Often there are nearby trees, but this simply allows a &quot;peekaboo&quot; as the viewer changes their point of perspective, or adds to the rustic appearance of the lodge-like buildings (Idaho, Washington, Germany, Sweden, etc).  This was pointed out to me in contrast to the landscaping at Seattle's Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposition in 1909, for example <a href=\"http://content.lib.washington.edu/u?/ayp,789\">here is the auditorium</a>.\n\nThe Ryerson and Burnham Archives have <a href=\"http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/u?/halic,2967\">a shot of the Florida State Building from a bit farther left</a> which really accentuates the unattractiveness of the structure and the cluttered palms and tropical plants alongside.\n\nSo here's a challenge to a patriotic Florida resident... why did they build a fort?  Was it a replica of a historically famous structure?  Were there exhibits inside that would spread word-of-mouth and draw people in despite the unappealing facade?", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "35278557-3409426253-72157617786721754", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/3409426253/#comment72157622643929366", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "26191326@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1256276225", "_content": "It is clearly the Spanish fort, the Castillo de San Marco, in St. Augustine.", "authorname": "castlebg754", "id": "35278557-3409426253-72157622643929366", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/3409426253/#comment72157622644049410", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1256278488", "_content": "@castlebg754: Thanks!\n\nHere's a <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/casa/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a> to the national monument.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "35278557-3409426253-72157622644049410", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3409426253"}, "flarchive:created": 1389363844}
