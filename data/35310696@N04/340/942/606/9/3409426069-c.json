His practice of planting new trees received much less press at the time, but today a goodly number of oaks in England have markers noting they were planted by Gladstone. \n\nWilliam Gladstone was British prime minister four times (1868\u201374, 1880\u20135, 1886, 1892\u20134). He had a major hand in shaping the Liberal party.\n\nAn article in the Encyclopedia of Britain says Gladstone's felling of trees, &quot;seems less eccentric nowadays, even if his other quirk of behaviour, wandering the streets at night to offer advice and protection to prostitutes, would still be considered unusual in a prime minister.&quot;\n\nBill Clinton considers Gladstone a visionary. \n\nPersonally I thought Gladstones' best speech was delivered at Newcastle on 7 October 1862 in which he supported the independence of the Confederate States of America, arguing that Jefferson Davis had &quot;made a nation&quot;.\n.", "authorname": "sixpounder", "id": "35278557-3409426069-72157619102072821", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3409426069"}, "flarchive:created": 1389363877}
