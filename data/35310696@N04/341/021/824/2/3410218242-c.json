This is the I&amp;M Canal at foreground with tow path in view on the Western bank.  This is where the Cal Sag feeder joined the canal at what is now the Sanitary District site to the west of Bily's Junkyard out at 83 and Archer.  That bridge in the background is probably for the Chicago and Alton.  See the water cistern for the steam engine?  This may even be Lambert Station itself.  If this could be viewed at a higher resolution, I may even be able to identify St. James church up on the hill to the left.  Perhaps the angle isn't far enough over.", "authorname": "sgt003", "id": "35278557-3410218242-72157624522729472", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3410218242"}, "flarchive:created": 1389364024}
