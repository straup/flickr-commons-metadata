It was completed in 1905 at a cost of $700,000.  The chief engineer of the city at the time of its completion was Julian Griggs.  The dam became known as Griggs Dam and grew to encompass a 521-acre recreational area providing biking, hiking, fishing, boating, and picnicking opportunities near Upper Arlington. \n\nWhen it was being built one dynamite blast broke twenty-two windows in the nearby farmhouse of the Harry Matthews family, a prominent early family in the area.  A third of a huge oak stump flew through the roof their second story porch, barely missing the lady of the house. The surveyors of the dam boarded in the same house.\n\nThen as now, the area was a destination spot for those wanting to escape &quot;the big city.&quot; Beginning around 1903 the interurban train which carried commuters to and from downtown Columbus during the week would take those who wanted to picnic or fish to the Columbus City parks near Griggs Dam on the weekends. The end of the line was just north of the dam and so it was &quot;fondly known to area residents as the Dam Car.&quot; Model T Ford automobiles (flivvers), buses, and trucks had replaced the interurban by 1925. The dam was also celebrated in James Thurber\u2019s story &quot;The Day the Dam Broke.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,237\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,424\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image in the &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw07p019i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-05\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.8 cm x 8.6 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, May 1918, page 19\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2691", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-05-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1363189315", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267137816"}, "originalsecret": "15a3b6ff99", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2793", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4387783105/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
