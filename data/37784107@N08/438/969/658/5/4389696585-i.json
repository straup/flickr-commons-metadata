Kern and his wife, Mary (Hill) Kern, came from Bellaire, Ohio, and Franklin County, respectively, and resided at 1949 Chelsea Road. They were among the first residents of Upper Arlington. Mr. Kern graduated from the Ohio State University in 1902, where Mrs. Kern was a classmate. The Kerns had four children: Mary Katherine, Virginia Elizabeth, William F. Jr., and Robert George. As of the printing of the Norwester article in 1918, Mrs. Kern's brothers, Clifford M. and John T. Hill, who both served in the military during WWI, lived with the Kerns. Mrs. Kern's mother, Virginia Hill, also resided with the family. William F. Kern was active in the governance of Upper Arlington. He was a member of the first village council in 1918 and served as a city commissioner in the 1920s. Sports also played an important role in his life. He was a pitcher for the Ohio State baseball team and, later, was an avid horseshoe pitcher. Mr. Kern was the president of the Columbus Builders' Supply Company, Buckeye Coal Supply Company, and the Charleston Builders' Supply Company. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,183\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,459\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw08p009i02\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-06\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.7 cm x 7.5 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, June 1918, page 9\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1015", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-06-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1347320890", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267208953"}, "originalsecret": "a43bb1556a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4019", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4389696585/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
