Although he officially graduated with his class, a month prior to graduation he enlisted and was at the time training at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. When this class entered high school they numbered nineteen. Of this original number eight graduated in 1918. Two of the nineteen graduated the previous year; two graduated from other high schools; seven of the class dropped out before completing courses; as described here, Edward Barker graduated but had enlisted one month prior to graduation; two of the class had extra work to finish before completing high school.\n\nThe first class to graduate from Grandview was in 1916. Prior to 1925, seniors from Upper Arlington were sent to Grandview or North High School for their last year, because Upper Arlington Schools did not offer a twelfth grade.\n\nAs the school year ended in 1918 the graduating seniors participated in the following activities: Class Day exercises; senior party and picnic; and Baccalaureate sermon, entitled \u201cThe Rewards of Diligence\u201d at Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church by Pastor Reverend B. F. Jackson. The Commencement exercises were held May 15 with an invocation by the Reverend O. C. Weist and performances by the Glee Club and the school orchestra.  A class address was given by The Honorable O. T. Corson, former State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Diplomas were presented by John H. Nau, president of the Board of Education. The benediction was given by the Reverend B. F. Jackson.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,221\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,409\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw07p008i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-05\nOriginal Dimensions: 1.9 cm x 2.8 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, May 1918, page 8\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2046", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-05-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1281543075", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267056226"}, "originalsecret": "b648223e9a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4004", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4386233494/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
