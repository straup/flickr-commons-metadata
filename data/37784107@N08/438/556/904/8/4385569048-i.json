Hollar and his wife, Sarah (Douglass) Hollar came from Bradford, Pennsylvania, and Paterson, New Jersey, respectively. They resided at 1952 Concord Road with their three sons: Bartley Douglass, John Bertkau, and George Bailey. Mr. Hollar was employed by the Frolaset Corset Company. An avid tennis player, he won the Labor Day tennis tournament in 1918. He was also a member of the Upper Arlington baseball team that participated in inter-village games with Grandview Heights. \n\nThe Hollar residence at 1952 Concord Road was purchased by Herbert Osborn in 1919. Herbert Osborn was born in Walworth County, Wisconsin, but spent his childhood in Fairfax, Iowa, where he received his education. He graduated from Iowa State College in 1879 and spent the next eighteen years teaching zoology and entomology there. Professor Osborn moved to Ohio in 1898 to teach and head the Department of Zoology and Entomology at The Ohio State University, a position he held for an additional eighteen years. Osborn later served as national director of the biological survey and research professor of entomology at Ohio State. The author of several college textbooks, Professor Osborn was also a member of Sigma Xi fraternity and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \n\nA photograph of this home was also used in a December 1917 advertisement by R. O. Austin, contractor and builder. Three other homes were shown in the same advertisement: the Carmack home at 1740 Roxbury Road, the Wescott home at 1811 Bedford Road, and the Palmer home at 1789 Bedford Road.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,181\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,422\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw07p017i02\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-05\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.6 cm x 7.7 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, May 1918, page 17\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1430", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-05-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1294050703", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267037160"}, "originalsecret": "d37fc1719d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2707", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4385569048/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
