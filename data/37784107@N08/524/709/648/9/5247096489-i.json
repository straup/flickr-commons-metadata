He was a strong supporter of all the soldiers fighting for the Allied Powers. His only son, John, was killed in action in the Battle of Loos in 1916.\n\nIn a New York Times article dated December 29, 1918, two months before this photograph was printed in the Norwester magazine, Kipling and his wife (an American) were interviewed at their home in the English countryside. He praised the Y.M.C.A. in Britain saying &quot;The soldiers must have plenty of amusement. They have no time to talk of war when out of the trenches. They want to be entertained.&quot; \n\nThis image accompanied an article in the February 1919 Norwester magazine by John Pontius, Upper Arlington resident, secretary of the Columbus Y.M.C.A. and tireless advocate for the organization. In his article he states that the Y.M.C.A. provided a vital service to the soldiers. He relates an experience he had in Britain in which he was saluted by a soldier. When he told the soldier that he did not need to salute, the soldier replied, &quot;Well, we always salute the Y.M.C.A. Nobody else does so much for us over here as the &quot;Y&quot; does and it's a pleasure to do it.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,319\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,653\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw16p013i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1919-02\nOriginal Dimensions: 11.5 cm X 7.5 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, February 1919, page 13\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7941", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1294157974", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1291933634"}, "originalsecret": "d3cc7798c2", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5006", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/5247096489/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
