Lockhart and his wife, Joanna Kenyon (Mix) Lockhart, came from Albany, Indiana, and Friendship, New York, respectively, and resided at 1957 Chelsea Road with their three children, Elizabeth, Melvin, and Joanna. Dr. Lockhart received his Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees from Indiana State University and a doctorate in Philosophy from Cornell University. Dr. Lockhart was a professor of Economics at Ohio State University. \n\nThe Lockhart residence was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth P. Ogden near the end of 1918. Mr. Ogden, a Columbus native, and his wife, Maud (McAlpin) Ogden, had two children, McAlpin Price &quot;Mac&quot; and Jean McAlpin Ogden. Mr. Ogden graduated from North High School. He later attended The Ohio State University, where he received a degree in ceramic engineering in 1905. His vocation led him to the clay deposits of Idaho, New York, Georgia, and Tennessee, where he did practical engineering work with terra cotta and paving brick. Closer to home, Mr. Ogden was an engineering consultant for both the J. B. Owens Kiln Company and the American China Company, both based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Ogden served as chairman of the membership committee of the Norwester Women's Club.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,184\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,468\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw08p014i02\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-06\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.7 cm x 7.5 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, June 1918, page 14\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1270", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-06-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284151050", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267208957"}, "originalsecret": "017fa7ef78", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4046", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4390464664/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
