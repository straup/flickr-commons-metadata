Rogers was born in Flint, Michigan in 1875. He moved to Ohio as a child and later attended The Ohio State University, from which he graduated in 1899. Rogers' wife, Florence (Harvey) Rogers also attended Ohio State; the couple resided at 1972 Tremont Road. In 1919, Mrs. Rogers was elected president of the Norwester Women's Club, an Upper Arlington organization dedicated to promoting community fellowship, study, and recreation. Mr. Rogers made his living in the wholesale lumber business. After the village of Upper Arlington was incorporated on March 20, 1918, Frank Rogers was named one of six Village Commissioners. At the first town meeting, Mr. Rogers was appointed to serve on a five-member committee responsible for the reappraisal of property and buildings in Upper Arlington. As village commissioner, he was involved in the creation of the first charter for the government of Upper Arlington. In addition to his work in the local government, Mr. Rogers was a (thirty-second degree) Mason. He was also known among his Upper Arlington neighbors as an expert fisherman and was an enthusiastic member of the Upper Arlington Fishing Club, established in 1917. Mr. Rogers was an avid sportsman who was active in the Upper Arlington Tennis Club. He also enjoyed pitching horseshoes and served as official scorer for the Upper Arlington baseball team. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,114\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,172\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw12p012i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-10\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.2 cm x 6.4 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, October 1918, page 12\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1916", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-10-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284139754", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1271447650"}, "originalsecret": "e2e985c813", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4062", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4526668236/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
