Edwin Harris was born in 1868 in Columbus, Ohio. Harris married Melissa Woolare in 1896, and the couple had two sons: Edwin W., and Robert J. The family resided at 1750 Upper Chelsea Road. Edwin W. Harris served in France during World War I, and Robert Harris attended The Ohio State University. J. Edwin Harris was employed by the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company for over thirty years but found time for sports, including baseball, football, and horseshoe pitching. In 1918, after Upper Arlington was incorporated as a village, Harris was one of six councilmen elected to govern the community. The new commission was responsible for, among other things, assigning street numbers to new homes for mail delivery, organizing the Village Commission meetings, and appointing Dr. Earl Ryan as Upper Arlington health officer. Upon the adoption of the Village Charter in March of 1919, Harris was elected as a member of the Upper Arlington Charter Commission. Melissa Harris was also involved in the social life of Upper Arlington and frequently offered her home as a meeting place for the Norwester Club. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,126\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,655\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw16p018i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1919-02\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.7 cm x  5.0 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, February 1919, page 18\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "8315", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1919-02-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284137403", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283200855"}, "originalsecret": "6cbce1301f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4115", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4942495335/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
