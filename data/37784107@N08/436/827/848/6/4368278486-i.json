After graduating from North High School, Mr. Armstrong worked for the Central Ohio Paper Company before joining the sales force of the Upper Arlington Company. At the time of this article, Mr. Armstrong and his wife, the former Miss Susan Carmack, had two children, Warren C. and Timothy G. Mr. Armstrong was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hiking, horseshoe pitching, was president of the local Angler's Club, and scoutmaster of Troop 10 of the Boy Scouts of America. He was also active in the early government of Upper Arlington. Mr. Armstrong was elected as the treasurer of the first Village Commission, served on the Board of Appraisers, and was a Deputy Marshall in 1918. His son, Warren C. Armstrong, served as the mayor of Upper Arlington from 1958 through 1964. The Armstrong home at 1761 Roxbury was the fifth home to be built in Upper Arlington. However, Armstrong family members are considered to be the first residents of Upper Arlington, other than the Millers and the Howards, because they lived above the Gun Club until their home was completed.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,49\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,215\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw02p016i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1917-12\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.4 cm x 6.8 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, December 1917, page 16\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1147", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1917-12-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284153740", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1266510218"}, "originalsecret": "6265f4c42b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4017", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4368278486/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
