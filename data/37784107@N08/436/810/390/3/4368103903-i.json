The residence was featured in the January 1918 issue of the Norwester magazine. Mr. Barker graduated from Ohio State in 1908, with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. He became a professor of Agricultural Chemistry and Soils at Ohio State in 1916. Mr. Barker was elected to the Upper Arlington School Board in 1922. His wife, Sophie (Hargis) Barker, was a contributor to the Norwester magazine and an active member of the community. The Barkers had two children, Josephine June and Joseph Clinton.  \n\nIn 1919 the Willard S. Crater family moved into the home at 1802 Coventry Road. Mr. Crater was employed by the Bell Telephone Company for many years. During the adoption of the Village Charter in March of 1919, Crater was elected as a member of the Upper Arlington Charter Commission and was integral to the framing of the document. In addition to his civic responsibilities, Mr. Crater enjoyed gardening and playing baseball. Mr. Crater was married to the former Rilla Lue Warner, and they had one child, Willard S. Crater, Jr.\n\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,71\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,248\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw03p014i02\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-01\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.8 cm x 7.7 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, January 1918, page 14\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1224", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284152720", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1266526111"}, "originalsecret": "9cdd464cbb", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4012", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4368103903/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
