Zimmerman was born in Oakwood, Ohio in 1890 but moved to Columbus with his family when he was a child. He was educated in engineering at Ohio University and transferred his interest in mechanics to a career in the family automobile business. In 1913, Zimmerman married Ethyle Cather, a native of Athens, Ohio, and, in 1918, they had a son, Robert Orr Zimmerman. The family resided at 1790 Cambridge Boulevard. Mr. Zimmerman had a special interest in outdoor sports, particularly hunting and fishing. Zimmerman's hunting expedition in the Canadian Rockies with Upper Arlington resident Ben Thompson was detailed in a November 1920 issue of the Norwester, complete with descriptions of the large game seen and hunted by the pair in British Columbia. Zimmerman submitted his own account of the trip to the Norwester, documenting the geography and vegetation of the region. Zimmerman also enjoyed pitching horseshoes and playing baseball. In 1920, he served as captain of the Upper Arlington &quot;Lobsters&quot; who battled the rival &quot;Crabs&quot; in the village baseball tournament. Mr. Zimmerman personally donated the &quot;Zimmerman Cup&quot; the trophy awarded to the winning baseball team. He was also a member of the Upper Arlington Fishing Club and the president of the Upper Arlington Gymnasium Club, which oversaw the organization of indoor sports such as hand ball and volley ball. He was active in the Kiwanis and Athletic Clubs, and served as director of the Columbus Auto Trade Association. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,123\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,565\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw15p010i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1919-01\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.8 cm x 5.0 cm  \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, January 1919, page 10\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2426", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1919-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284138696", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1278622456"}, "originalsecret": "72e67fec7e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4080", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4774903555/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
