Mr. Mahaffey had two degrees from The Ohio State University and was a member of Phi Lambda Upsilon. After moving to Upper Arlington, he became the editor of the Norwester magazine. Prior to accepting that position, Mahaffey was a chemistry instructor at the local High School of Commerce and at The Ohio State University. Mrs. Mahaffey attended Ohio University and was a member of Phi Beta Phi. Before moving to their home on Bedford Road, the Mahaffeys lived on East Northwood Avenue where Mr. Mahaffey was well-loved by his neighbors and very active in community affairs. Mr. Mahaffey was appointed to the first school board in Upper Arlington where he served as secretary-treasurer and then as superintendent until April 1919. He also later served as principal of South High School. The Mahaffey residence was subsequently purchased by Harry M. Miller. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,201\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,507\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw09p025i02\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-07\nOriginal Dimensions: 12.7 cm x 7.7 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, July 1918, page 25\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1126", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-07-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284149651", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267650597"}, "originalsecret": "d8c1589faa", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4063", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4404953012/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
