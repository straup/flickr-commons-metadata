McIntyre and his wife, Helen (Runyan) McIntyre, were from Columbus and Morrow, Ohio, respectively, and resided at 1814 Roxbury Road with their daughter Mary Jane. Mr. McIntyre received his higher education at Holy Cross School. He was employed by Gem Coal and Supply Co. and was active in the organization and development of the Columbus Automobile Club. In his spare time, he enjoyed horseback riding. McIntyre operated a pony farm near Delaware, Ohio where he raised ponies for use in the mines. He also enjoyed automobile races that were occasionally held at the Columbus Driving Park.  \n\nThe McIntyre home was purchased by the Percy M. Minshall family. Mr. Minshall was born in London, Ohio in 1880 and received his high school education in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He and his wife, Lillian (Thompson) Minshall, had two children, Marion and Virginia. Mr. Minshall was employed as a cashier in the Columbus office of the Bankers' Life Insurance Company of America for many years. He was also a member of the Shriners' fraternity.
