He had two degrees from The Ohio State University and was a member of Phi Lambda Upsilon. Before becoming editor of the community paper, Mahaffey was a chemistry instructor at the local High School of Commerce and at The Ohio State University. His wife, the former Adelyn Swisher of Warren, Ohio, attended Ohio University and was a member of Phi Beta Phi. Before moving to their home on Bedford Road, the Mahaffeys lived on East Northwood Avenue where Mr. Mahaffey was well-loved by his neighbors and very active in community affairs. Mr. Mahaffey was appointed to the first school board in Upper Arlington, where he served as secretary-treasurer and then as superintendent until April 1919. He later served as principal of South High School. The Mahaffey residence at 1767 Bedford Road was later purchased by Harry M. Miller. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,110\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,507\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw09p025i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-07\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.3 cm x 6.4 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, July 1918, page 25\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1019", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-07-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284149667", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267650594"}, "originalsecret": "e1a916d5c8", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2765", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4404952880/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
