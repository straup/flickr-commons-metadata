Pontius (on the left in this photograph) was an Upper Arlington resident who served in World War I. He was the secretary of the Columbus YMCA and sent back regular reports of the war. One poignant letter that he began writing while crossing the Atlantic from the U.S. to Britain in May 1918 was printed in the June 1918 Norwester magazine. The letter was written over several days and describes the weather during the voyage--the tipping of ship and the fog--and the fact that he has not experienced the seasickness that his fellow passengers have. He addresses his five-year-old daughter Jean when he mentions the sighting of a whale. Pontius was kept busy as the Director of Activities. He describes the many kindnesses and deprivations of the British people once he reaches the British Isles. He expresses confidence that &quot;Fritz will be licked&quot; and is cautious throughout his letter not to mention anything that could compromise the war effort if it fell into the wrong hands.\n\nPontius came back from the war and resumed his activities in Upper Arlington for many years following. His wife Hazel, also active in the community, was a school board member from 1918 to 1927. They lived at 1644 Cambridge Boulevard.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,246\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,466\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw08p012i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-06\nOriginal Dimensions: 5.7 cm x 9.7 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, June 1918, page 12\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1846", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-06-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1378666339", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1267571338"}, "originalsecret": "1e52440184", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4020", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4402635058/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
