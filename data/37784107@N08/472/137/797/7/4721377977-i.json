He spent his teenage years in Colorado and attended Denver University, but later transferred to The Ohio State University, where he graduated in 1906. Known simply as &quot;Dave&quot; by his college friends, Warwick was the original Ohio State cheerleader. After graduation, Warwick became an English professor at a high school in Ironwood, Michigan but left after a year to become a traveling salesman. In 1909, Warwick married Hazel Ruth Hain, of Columbus, and the couple had two children, Herbert Sherwood, Jr., and Mary Elizabeth. The family resided in Upper Arlington at 1690 Arlington Avenue. Warwick served as the first full-time secretary of the Ohio State Alumni Association and, in 1913, founded the Association of Alumni Secretaries, predecessor to the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). CASE's yearly H. S. Warwick Research Award was named after this Ohio native. CASE, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington D.C., bestows this honor in recognition of exceptional writing in philanthropy, communications, and alumni relations. Warwick served as General Agent for Ohio with the State Mutual Life Insurance Company, and, in 1917, became Vice President and Director of Sales for the Upper Arlington Company. Warwick divided his spare time between the Rotary Club, the Upper Arlington baseball club, the Boy Scout Council, the Y.M.C.A., and the War Camp Community Service. He also served as business manager of the Upper Arlington &quot;Norwester&quot; upon its establishment in 1917. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,120\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,589\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw14p010i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-12\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.7 cm x 5.1 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, December 1918, page 10\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2451", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-12-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1282863727", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1277147055"}, "originalsecret": "c51c9ce7e1", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1162", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4721377977/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
