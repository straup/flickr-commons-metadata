The photograph's caption was &quot;The First Type of White Man's Home in Columbus.&quot; The article explained that Chillicothe was the original state capital, but in February 1810 the Ohio Legislature appointed five commissioners to determine a more centralized location for the capital. The chosen site was on the high east bank of the Scioto River where it would have access to transportation for goods and people yet not be prone to flooding. There was no settlement on the site they had chosen. The land was covered with forest and subject to altercations with the Indians who were trying to maintain their land. One small cabin stood on the east riverbank in a former Delaware Indian encampment. It belonged to a man by the name of John Brickell. Brickell had been abducted by the Delaware Indians near Pittsburgh in 1791 when he was ten years old.  He lived with an Indian family for four years until the Treaty of Greenville secured the release of all white captives in the Northwest Territory. When he was released he moved from the Maumee River to the Scioto River near present-day Columbus and continued to live as an Indian. He remained in the Central Ohio area while the new state capital grew and prospered.  He died in 1844.\n\nA log cabin also once stood on the site of the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington. The cabin was built circa 1835 by the parents of Dr. William Galbraith and was preserved under the siding of the Galbraith milk house until the shopping center was built in 1959. At that time the cabin was relocated to Hocking County, where it became the family's vacation home.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,308\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,616\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw15p016i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1919-01\nOriginal Dimensions: 10.1 cm x 7.0 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, January 1919, page 16\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Columbus (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4270", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1386074301", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1281380393"}, "originalsecret": "d434f88380", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4134", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4876085941/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
