Smokestacks from Columbus factories can be seen billowing smoke in the background. The river figured prominently in early life in Upper Arlington, with regular fishing and picnic excursions held along its banks. In addition, Dr. Henry Miller, a physician, built his home on a farm overlooking the Scioto River in 1862, in an attempt to escape the pollution of the city. Dr. Miller's previous home was on Broad Street in Columbus, across the street from what was once the Center of Science and Industry (COSI). He moved his family further up the Scioto River from their original downtown location hoping that it would improve the health of his son, James Terrell Miller, and it did. James Terrell Miller eventually sold portions of the Miller Farm to King and Ben Thompson to form what would become Upper Arlington. The first bridge over the Scioto River in Franklin County was the downtown Broad Street Bridge, built by Lucas Sullivant in 1816.\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,292\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,557\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image in the &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw13p026i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-11\nOriginal Dimensions: 11.5 cm x 7.5 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, November 1918, page 26\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Columbus (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1656", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-11-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1281543271", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1276621794"}, "originalsecret": "1003ee8c1c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4063", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4703224105/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
