After an early start as a businessman, Mr. Thomson studied and became successful in systemizing factory work. In September 1904, John married Mabel Jackson, a native of England, and together they had a daughter, Evelyn. The family moved back to Ohio where Mr. Thomson established his business system in several of the larger manufacturing plants of Columbus. The family resided at 1810 Coventry Road. By 1918, Mr. Thomson had joined the automobile distributing firm of Carroll &amp; Thompson. John was a &quot;quiet, modest, retiring gentleman&quot; a member of the Upper Arlington Fishing Club who enjoyed tennis, bowling and swimming. Thomson's daughter, Evelyn, died tragically at the age of fifteen but left an impressive record of community involvement. She was one of six Upper Arlington students elected by the student body to serve as school commissioners. In March of 1919, she contributed a report to the Norwester describing the success of the first children's party held at the Upper Arlington schoolhouse, where Mr. Thomson was in charge of showing the &quot;moving pictures.&quot; \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,118\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,551\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw13p020i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-11\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.8 cm x 6.4 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, November 1918, page 20\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2277", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-11-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284139255", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1276621797"}, "originalsecret": "b92e797568", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4027", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4703224215/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
