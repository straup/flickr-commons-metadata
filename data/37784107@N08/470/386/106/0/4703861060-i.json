After completing high school at an early age, Yeatman Wardlow continued his education as a student scholar at Kenyon College, in Ohio, and later at Columbia University. Dr. Wardlow practiced as a surgeon for many years in Columbus before becoming chief of staff at the local Protestant hospital, which, in 1918, was located on Park Street near Buttles Ave. In 1922 the Protestant Hospital joined the Ohio Methodist Episcopal Conference and was renamed White Cross Hospital. In 1961 the hospital was moved to its current site and is now known as Riverside Methodist Hospital. Dr. Wardlow married Helen Leahy, a Columbus woman and a graduate of The Ohio State University. The couple had a daughter, Judith. At the time of publication, Mrs. Wardlow's brother, Captain T. R. Leahy, of the 62nd field artillery, was residing with the family at 2011 West Devon Road. The February 1919 issue of the Norwester published a letter from Captain Leahy detailing his memories of a military campaign he observed near Montainville, France. Dr. Wardlow was a skilled tennis player and occasionally reminisced about the time he played in a national tennis finals match in Madison Square Gardens in New York City. He also maintained a lifetime interest in &quot;finely bred&quot; dogs. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,119\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,555\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw13p024i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-11\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.8 cm x 6.3 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, November 1918, page 24\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1868", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-11-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1284152623", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1276621815"}, "originalsecret": "4686f8884e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4042", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4703861060/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
