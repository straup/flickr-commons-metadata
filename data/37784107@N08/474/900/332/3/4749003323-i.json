He graduated from Steele High School and later attended the College of Agriculture at The Ohio State University, where he was known by his Kappa Sigma brothers as &quot;Pat&quot;. Wuichet married Ruth Pierce, also an Ohio State graduate, in 1909. The couple resided for a number of years on a small farm in western Ohio, where they raised Hampshire swine. There they had two children, John Jr. and Lois Jeannette. The Wuichets moved back to Columbus in 1915 when John Wuichet took a position in the animal husbandry department at Ohio State. The Wuichet family became very active in the social life of Upper Arlington. Ruth Wuichet was a member of the Upper Arlington Norwester Club. John Wuichet was president of the first Upper Arlington Board of Education. As a school board member, he was one of the organizers of the first Upper Arlington community meeting, where he gave a presentation on the status and future plans of Upper Arlington schools. In 1919, Wuichet was appointed &quot;Social Chairman&quot; by the Village Commission, which put him in charge of organizing winter recreation for the village of Upper Arlington. A high school gymnast, John Wuichet remained active as an adult, and he enjoyed tennis, baseball, and motoring in his spare time. The Wuichet family resided at 1775 Bedford Road. The residence was later purchased by Orville M. Johnson. In 1976, John W. Wuichet, Jr. was elected as vice president of the Upper Arlington Historical Society. Within a year of its creation, the society published the History of Upper Arlington, a written record of Upper Arlington comprised of personal interviews, maps, anecdotes, and local publications. \n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll10,122\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://ua-archives.cdmhost.com/u?/p4036coll9,586\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw14p022i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1918-12\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.8 cm x 5.1 cm\nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, December 1918, page 22\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"http://www.uahistory.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"http://www.ualibrary.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uaarchives.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2279", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1918-12-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1343439979", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1277919037"}, "originalsecret": "0a59b6a2bc", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4114", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/4749003323/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
