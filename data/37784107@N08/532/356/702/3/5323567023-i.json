While working in the roller skating business in Auburn, New York, he met his future wife Charlene Huston. The two married in 1907 and arrived in Columbus, Ohio later that year. They had two children, Virginia Josephine and Pierce Huston. After moving to Upper Arlington, the family resided at 1819 Coventry Road. Although Ralph Denman's work schedule kept him very busy, he made time for the occasional baseball game and earned a reputation among his neighbors as a &quot;&quot;top notch&quot;&quot; horseshoe pitcher.\n\nCharlene Denman was an active member of the Upper Arlington Norwester Women's Club. As leader of the Recreation Committee, one of the club's four subgroups, Mrs. Denman organized tennis matches and a summertime nature study. She also represented the Norwester Women's Club at the 1919 Upper Arlington Field Day. She was photographed riding the club's first parade float. \n\nBoth Pierce and Virginia Denman were students in the Upper Arlington school system. Pierce Denman was a member of the first Upper Arlington football team, founded in 1926. He was also a member of the Upper Arlington golf team, which was state runner up in the open school competition in 1928. Virginia Denman was a member of the Upper Arlington girls' basketball team. She participated in the 1918 Flag Day Pageant as one of &quot;&quot;Freedom's Sprites&quot;&quot; and also played the part of &quot;&quot;Ice&quot;&quot; in the school's Winter Pageant. Virginia Denman remained an important part of the community as a member of the Upper Arlington Bicentennial Committee. She made valuable contributions to the History of Upper Arlington, an account of the town published by the Upper Arlington Historical Society in 1977. \n\n\n<a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">This image available online at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n<a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read the related &quot;Norwester&quot; magazine article at the UA Archives &gt;&gt;</a>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIdentifier: hinw17p017i01\nDate (yyyy-mm-dd): c. 1919-03\nOriginal Dimensions: 3.7 cm x  5.0 cm \nFormat: Black and White Halftone Photograph\nSource: Norwester, March 1919, page 17\nOriginal Publisher: Upper Arlington Community (Ohio)\nLocation/s: Upper Arlington (USA, Ohio, Franklin County)\nRepository: <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Historical Society</a>\nDigital Publisher: <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Arlington Public Library</a>, <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">UA Archives</a>\n\n<i>Credit: UA Archives - Upper Arlington Public Library (Repository: UA Historical Society)</i>&quot;"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9437", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1919-03-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1332117618", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1294156665"}, "originalsecret": "cb443c727b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5289", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/uaarchives/5323567023/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
