The tramway operated until 1954.[1] As the road next to the wharf had a grade of 1 in 8.25, a unique counterweight dummy system was installed under the road surface to help push trams up the hill. An underground counterweight system was connected by cable to a cable tram grip dummy on the track on the surface. A tram descending would push the grip dummy ahead of it (which raised the counterweight). On the return journey, the grip dummy would give the tram a helpful push. The mechanism was removed to the Sydney Tramway Museum when the tramway was removed...&quot;\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Great detective work again!
