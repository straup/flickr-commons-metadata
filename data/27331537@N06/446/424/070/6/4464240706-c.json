Wikipedia in this case has its dates wrong. According to Max Kelly's 'Faces of the Street: William Street, Sydney, 1916', the authoritative study of the William Street widening, the gazetted date of resumption was 1 June 1916. However, the physical demolition was deferred for about 3 years. In total 94 properties were resumed in order to widen the road from 41 to 100 feet. Between 10 and 19 June 1916 an unknown photographer for the City of Sydney photographed the entire length of the south side of the street. The series forms part of the Demolition Books.

Note the tell tale close spaced double wires in the foreground sky. This is trolleybus wire (+ and - wires). So the trolleybuses are up and running.\n\nWhy the discrepancy in time between road widening and realignment of tracks ? This is a classic Sydney tale. ... Because the City Council resumed properties and widened the street without gaining agreement with the State run and owned tramways to realign the tracks ! There was no pressing maintenance requirement to replace the running surface for the trams and the City Council would have squibbed at the thought of paying the NSWGT for moving the trackwork. \n\nThis nonsense would never happen in Europe. In Europe the tramways would have be run by the City Government and co-operation rather than 'competition' would rule. Here we have a wonderful visual example of an English origin system of government in action ! (ie you separate powers and responsibilities until no specific agency has what it needs to do the actual job).", "authorname": "Hurley21", "id": "27286215-4464240706-72157624879902364", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4464240706/#comment72157624790904543", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1284033579", "_content": "Thanks for that Hurley21.\n\nHere's another of the William Street tram track realignment photos, dated 26 June 1934\n<a href=\"http://www3.photosau.com/cos1/scripts/ExtSearch.asp?SearchTerm=018165\" rel=\"nofollow\">www3.photosau.com/cos1/scripts/ExtSearch.asp?SearchTerm=0...</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-4464240706-72157624790904543", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4464240706/#comment72157624919109568", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1284067804", "_content": "Yes, thanks Hurley21.
