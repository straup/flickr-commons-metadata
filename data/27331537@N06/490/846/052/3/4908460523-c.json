There was an earlier statue of Captain Cook in Hyde Park, before the one that was unveiled in 1879 (which was commissioned in 1874).\n\n&quot;<b>CAPTAIN COOK'S STATUE</b> Sir, - While crossing Hyde Park yesterday I stopped to read the inscription, or intended inscription. On coming to the place where he was killed, I thought it would be a pity to let this pass unnoticed, as it is not properly spelled, or the place known, perhaps, but by a few. It reads thus:- &quot;Killed at Owhyhee in 1779.&quot; Now, how many persons know anything of this island by the above inscription? I venture to say very few indeed. I beg to suggest to those who have the management of the inscription the following:- &quot;Killed at Kealakeakua, Island of Hawaii, Sandwich Islands, 1779.&quot; This would be proper, as it is the present style of spelling the name of that island, and the place at which he was killed. I most respectfully offer this suggestion before the inscription is cut, which is at present only painted. Yours, &amp;c., An Observer.
