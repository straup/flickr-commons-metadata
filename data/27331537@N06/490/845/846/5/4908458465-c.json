Probably done as James Barnet the Government Architect's visual record, in very similar style, quality, and time period as the Callan Park / Gladesville photos.\n\nThere are a couple of Goulburn Gaol photos in the State Library (via the Government Printing Office) which are different but from the same series (imho) - \n<a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=168078\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=168078</a>\n<a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=168079\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=168079</a>\n\nThe second photo has to be a reverse view of this 3-tier &quot;unidentified gaol interior&quot; (mentioned above) - \n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000678\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\n\nThe &quot;unidentified gaol chapel&quot; - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000673\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a> is most likely the building at the centre of the complex, mentioned in the Heritage NSW site above.\n\nThere are several identified exterior views of Goulburn Gaol under construction (ie 1884) -\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000667\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000312\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000668\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\n\nAnd one which is wrongly identified (imho) - no hipped roofs at Goulburn -\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000313\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\n\nThese two are a mystery - the style of the doors and interior are different, and there are signs of wear and tear on the walls and handrails.
