This is looking south, with the racecourse to the left, at the end of the pedestrian overbridge, and OLSH / St Pauls Seminary on the hill, at right.  The trams are moving away from the camera, toward the Ascot St exit.  Note also the dividing fence to stop people from wandering across the tracks, and the stub finials on the tramway-style steel poles, a few of which still remain in Sydney streets.", "authorname": "lunchbox76", "id": "27286215-3793215071-72157625118334772", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3793215071/#comment72157625136302792", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1286751545", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/36196524@N08] Thanks, I have amended the caption.\nAB", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-3793215071-72157625136302792", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "3793215071"}, "flarchive:created": 1389680540}
