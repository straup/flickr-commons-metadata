I didn't realise Minto had settled so early. Also I love the area that says &quot;Cow Pasture&quot; now where modern day Hoxton Park, Hinchinbrook and Green Valley lie. \n\nWhy does the map appear to be on its &quot;side&quot; though? Appearing to show the areas of south-west Sydney facing north. It makes for a weird perspective.  I think I can see a symbol showing north, but I'm so used to seeing maps with north facing upward these days, it took a few seconds to get the sense of perspective on the map initially.", "authorname": "Larelle_M_R", "id": "27286215-3661720382-72157621884819925", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3661720382/#comment72157621889736417", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1250030927", "_content": "Larelle_M_R, I'm not sure if there is a specific reason, other than the presentation of the map.
