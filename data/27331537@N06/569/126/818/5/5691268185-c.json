This was not the first public official train which ran on 19/3/1932 and is the one for which tickets were being adveritsed above and travelling from Wynyard to North Sydney.\n\nThe train in the photo (19/1/1932) would NOT have operated into Wynyard station. Steam trains did not operate under their own power to and from Wynyard Station due to the problem the exhaust smoke causes in the confines of the tunnels leading to suffocation of the crew and passengers particularly on the return trip due to the steep grade.  The train in the photo would have operated only between Milson's Point and the Sydney end of the Harbour Bridge and then reversed back to Milson's Point station.  Further evidence to support this is the fact that the train in the photo is running &quot;wrong road&quot; - heading south (Up) on the Northbound (Down) track, indicating it was shuttling backwards and forwards across the bridge. Signalling/and works at North Sydney would not have been complete.  The train that ran on 19/3/1932 between North Sydney and Wynyard was an electric train that could proceed all the way into Wynyard Station.", "authorname": "albert3801", "id": "27286215-5691268185-72157626666702830", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5691268185/#comment72157626710670674", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1305291642", "_content": "I think it is north sydney.

That picture is titled &quot;Overhead-wiring erection train at Milsons Point Station&quot; and shows a very similar but not identical locomotive looking suitably grimy as befits a work train.  By the time this picture was made the platform surface had been cleaned up and was almost ready for the public.  Although my memory tells me that NSW suburban platforms were surfaced with crushed sandstone at least until my high school years in the 1970s, this platform looks a little too loose and sandy for public use in my opinion.  The trip hazard near the bubbler also tells me that it wasn't 100% ready for the public.\n\nThis picture from the same day:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6057732596/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6057732596/</a>\nshows Dr Bradfield riding the locomotive of this very same train as it crossed the bridge.  This loco was well cleaned and fit for a V.I.P. to rest his coat sleeve upon.\n\nSo, while I agree with the date shown, the title needs some clarification.  It was clearly not the first train across the bridge, as work trains had already been shuttling back and forth putting up wires and such.  It wasn't the first passenger train in the sense of it being a public conveyance.  This was a V.I.P. party of some kind on an inspection tour, possibly commemorating the completion of a stage of construction.", "authorname": "Anthony Farr", "id": "27286215-5691268185-72157630112722016", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5691268185/#comment72157632062157969", "realname": "John Cowper", "path_alias": "johncowper", "author": "21647809@N04", "iconserver": "7404", "datecreate": "1353499248", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw] AB: &quot;The Ubiquitous Dr Bradfield&quot; Gallery I and II have been established this evening.

The vid doesn't settle the issue re whether this was really the first train to cross the bridge (though here I'd agree with [http://www.flickr.com/photos/anthony_farr] ). With a bit more resolution and the assistance of the digitised newspapers, we might be able to identify quite a few of this crowd. I'm not 100% sure, but I'd say the chap we see with Ennis (Dorman Long &amp; Co director of construction) and Bradfield in the video at ca. 36:30 might be ?Charles/Clarence Hipwell, who was superintendent of steelworks erection with Dorman Long &amp; Co. We see him in this SMH pic of the Dorman Long staff <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1157143\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1157143</a> . I gather we see Hipwell in quite a few of the Harbour Bridge pics from the various collections...I suspect we also see Alfred Martin (assistant director of construction with DL) and even Henry Martin (superintendent of fabrication with DL) in some pics...the Martins were evidently brothers.\n\nLooks like the engineer and fireman from the train on the far lhs. Edith Bradfield is gallantly flying the flag for the women of Australia.\n\nSome of the NSW Public Works Department bridge staff in this group can be tentatively identified via this PHM collection pic -  <a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389453\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=389453</a> ; I gather the group would also include a few of the Dorman Long &amp; Co staff, plus the train crew and maybe a couple of other hangers on.\n\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8733000135r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> another pic...maybe taken on the Harbour Bridge", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "27286215-5691268185-72157632420007377", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5691268185"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620033}
