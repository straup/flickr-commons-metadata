The powerhouse driving it was located at Rushcutters Bay. Unlike other trams of the era which were driven by steam, the cable ran in a gutter between the tracks. The cars gripped the moving cable to advance and released it to stop. It operated until 1905 when the tram line was electrified.&quot;\n\nIt looks like the electric tram wires are here, which would date this as c.1905.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-3863900492-72157622165928842", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3863900492/#comment72157622391737148", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1253149053", "_content": "Thank you for the information regarding the cable tram service which has now allowed us to date the photograph.", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-3863900492-72157622391737148", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "3863900492"}, "flarchive:created": 1389621667}
