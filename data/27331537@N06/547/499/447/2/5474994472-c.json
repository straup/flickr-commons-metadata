The iron letter-receiver is a hollow cylinder of some two foot in diameter, and five feet three inches in height. Within a few inches of the top of the cylinder are three apertures, well protected from the weather by iron doors, which are affixed to the apertures by means of pivots, which enable the depositor to move the lids with the utmost facility. The letter inserted, the lid fulls over the aperture, and thus all accidents from rain, &amp;c, are precluded.</blockquote>\n- <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60248171\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60248171</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5474994472-72157632240548505", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5474994472"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620240}
