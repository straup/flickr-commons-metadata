Looking at Trove this may have happened in 1909/10 as there is indication of a contract issued for alterations and additions in September 1909 and in SMH of 11 Jan 1910 it says: 'Extensive alterations have been carried out to the Paragon Hotel, the interior having been completely transformed. The work was carried out by Messrs. D. Gawne and Sons, from plans under the supervision of Messrs. Morrow and De Putron, architects.' But of course they may have happened earlier than this - I just haven't found any evidence yet :-) Incidently the pub was first built in 1860 for Anthony Hordern and was run by the Watsons from the 1860s to 1933 when it was bought by Tooth &amp; Co. \n\nThe 'new' Ship Inn on the corner of Pitt and Alfred was built in 1902 replacing the original which was across the street and established in c1868. The original was demolished when Alfred Street was widened and the licencee moved to the new pub. The original site is basically in the the middle of Alfred Street. \n\nInterestingly looking at both their websites you would never know any of this as it's obviously not worth mentioning the 'ancient' history of trendy gastro pubs.\n\nSo far then this definitely fits with your 1905-1910 date range as it's hard to know when the additions were in fact carried out but we might be talking c1909/10\n\nAlso you might like this c1879-1887 image of the paragon! <a href=\"http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/gid/slv-pic-aab70439/1/b28130\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/gid/slv-pic-aab70439/1/b28130</a>\n\nright, i'll shut up now", "authorname": "agrippinamaior", "id": "27286215-6031629514-72157627445514172", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6031629514/#comment72157627321486439", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1313486947", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/agrippinamaior] Don't ever shut up!

I just happen to have beside  me a copy of the book by Graeme Andrews &quot;A Pictorial History of Ferries Sydney and surrounding waterways&quot; (Reed, 1982).   On page 32 is a photo taken from exactly this position, and possibly minutes away in time, like the Kerry photos above. I wish I could see the clocks!   \n\nBuildings and adverts are identical (but cropped out from the RH side of the Lands Department Building).  There are more ferries in his photo, and he identifies each of them.  The 'Kuring-Gai' at the Manly wharf, and the 'Bronzewing' are also in this photo (see notes).\n\nGraeme Andrews says in his blurb that &quot;World War One is a year or so away ...&quot;  ie.c.1912.  BUT he also describes the 'First and Last' Hotel as being pulled down in 1981, when in fact it was the 1911 rebuild which was destroyed then.  (See dunedoo's excellent and poignant series ot the 'new' hotel's 1981 demolition - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/29029178@N03/4655952814/\">www.flickr.com/photos/29029178@N03/4655952814/</a>  .)\n\nThe Hotel was mentioned as about to undergo alterations in September 1910 -\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15207874\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15207874</a> .  Somewhere I found an article saying it was an empty site in 1911,  implying that this photo (and the one in the Andrews book, and the Kerry photos) are all 1910.
