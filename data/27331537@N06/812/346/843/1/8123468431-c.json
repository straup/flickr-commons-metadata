As the site at Haslem's Creek was some distance from the centre of Sydney it was decided to build a spur line and eventually four railway stations were built in the Cemetery grounds.

The receiving-house at Haslem Creek is placed in the centre of the 200 acres set apart for the cemetery, and also in tho centre of an inner ring comprising 20 acres. The chapels to be erected by the several denominations will be around it. This building is a specimen of the Italian Gothic style, beautiful in proportion and ornamentation. It is a paralelogram, 98 feet 6 inches by 42 feet. This figure is divided longitudinally into three parts, a nave with side aisles, by two rows of circular columns, with richly-carved capitals. From these columns spring pointed arches, carrying the wall upon which rests the main roof. The sides of the building are entirely open. The rails will run through the nave, the side aisles and a portion of the nave forming platforms. The plain walls are built of 6-inch courses of rock faced work, pointed with black mortar. The whole of the interior timber work of the open roof will be painted in neutral tint, .picked out in primitive colours.  The roof will be covered with slate in ornamental design, the entire length being terminated with an iron ridge cresting of quaint design. In these buildings it is difficult to say which is the most remarkable, the taste of the architect, Mr. Barnett, or the faithful and persevering skill of the general contractors, Messrs. Stoddard and Medway for Redfern, and Mr. Aaron Loveridge for Haslem Creek. ... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nI reckon all these photos are 1869, not &quot;c.1865&quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-8123468431-72157631855840669", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8123468431/#comment72157631870790173", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1351427010", "_content": "Update <b>1871</b> by photographer <b>Charles Pickering</b>.
