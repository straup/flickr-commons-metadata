You had to climb the ladder and hold onto the railing to change the plates that hang on hooks for platforms and train names, or to rotate the &quot;Direction&quot; by the knobs at the left, and to move the clock hands. Presumably the cupboards are to store number and name plates. It can only display trains for a two-hour period which would mean alot of climbing. No wonder they replaced it fairly quickly.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-8123485974-72157632895504744", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8123485974"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618898}
