It is in fact a public playground built by the Sydney Harbour Trust. The Lance Playground, 37 High Street, Millers Point (<a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=high+street+millers+point&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=37.069935,56.513672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=High+St,+Sydney+New+South+Wales+2000&amp;ll=-33.859704,151.202878&amp;spn=0.008428,0.013797&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-33.859672,151.202876&amp;panoid=j0lSf3H4VIugsu4Kw_r5jA&amp;cbp=12,94.1,,0,-5.54\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Maps Street View</a>) was the first public playground to be erected in Sydney. Hence this journalist's exuberance: AT LAST! A PLAYGROUND! - &quot;... Long may the sweet voices of the babies wake the echoes of that rugged wall! ...&quot; - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15359745\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday 26 June 1912, p. 5.</a>\n\n&quot;Between 1908 and 1915 the bulk of Millers Point's new housing stock was erected by the Sydney Harbour Trust and the Public Works Department. This included, in 1912, the Lance Playground in High Street. The Lance Kindergarten site located between the two rows of terraces in High Street was first developed as a community playground for the use of Millers Point residents. The earliest structures on the site were a brick shelter structure, toilet block and a shaded sandpit. The playground was reputedly the first public playground in the City of Sydney. The mature plane trees which occupy the site were also in place at this time. The Playground was opened by Lady Chelmsford in 1913 [<b>actually it was Monday 14 October 1912 - see</b> <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15367592\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 15 October 1912, p. 10</a>]. At the end of 1914 at the request of the Harbour Trust, the Kindergarten Union took over the management of the Lance Playground and decided to work it in conjunction with the Kindergarten [in Bettington Street]. In 1924 it was decided that the need for both a kindergarten and a playground diminished. The committee decided to carry on the Kindergarten work at the playground in High Street. Necessary alterations and enlarging of building was carried out by the Harbour Trust. This was opened in 1925 [see <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16232698\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 11 May 1925, p. 4.</a>] and became known as the Lance Kindergarten after the President of the Harbour Trust.&quot; - <a href=\"https://majorprojects.affinitylive.com/public/fdb83a72ca7caa42d63a87b241dc2c/Appendix A Heritage Impact Statement  Part 2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">majorprojects.affinitylive.com/public/fdb83a72ca7caa42d63...</a>\n\nCHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND. HARBOUR TRUST LEADS. OPENED BY LADY CHELMSFORD. - &quot;The first public playground in the city situated in the Rocks area facing Darling Harbour was officially opened by Lady Chelmsford yesterday afternoon. ... The area of the ground is 100ft by 80ft. Half of it is paved with wood blocks covered with sand, the remainder being a grass plot. There is a sand pit under cover, see-saws, a toboggan with another heap of sand at the foot, and a playshed. And every day an army of laughing children may be seen romping about on the grass or delving in the sand as happy as happy can be.&quot; - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15367592\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 15 October 1912, p. 10.</a> Note that the shade has not yet been built for the sandpit, which dates this series of photos to before the official opening, ergo 1912.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2695259392/][http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2694441047/]", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5913614191-72157627020152721", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5913614191/#comment72157627151272974", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1310194395", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet] Excellent stuff!
