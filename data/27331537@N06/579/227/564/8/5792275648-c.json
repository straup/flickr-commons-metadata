The side nearing the old tram sheds (in this photo) is still largely dirt, the expansion of the lines in the early 20th century caused the resumption of this land for an additional track and reconfiguration of this platform, ultimately removing the platforms on the middle and right and adding again an additional train track between to allow 6 tracks pass through.  This resumption of land also included a nearby street called Crescent street, which was west of the over line bridge, evidence of this streets existence can be made by the odd placement of a Double storey terrace which fronts directly on to the additional track.\n\nNow in 2010-2011 further resumption of the tram shed land is being used to provide an easy access to Newtown station, adding a lift, and demolition of the existing island canopy.\n\nDoes anyone have a good photo of Crescent street before the resumption in 1927?", "authorname": "Historically Sympathetic", "id": "27286215-5792275648-72157627040387784", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5792275648/#comment72157627021816957", "realname": "Amy S", "path_alias": "as500", "author": "35117516@N00", "iconserver": "29", "datecreate": "1310137764", "_content": "ah that explains the house(s) that face the tracks.
