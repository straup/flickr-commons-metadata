However based on the licensee's name painted above the door, the date of this image is between 1887 and mid 1889. To me this suggests that it may be one of a series of images taken of buildings damaged by the Kent Street sewer construction.\n\nThe name of the licensee painted curved above the door is Louisa Leistikow. In the 1886 annual list for the Metropolitan Licensing District published in NSW Government Gazette No 430 10 August 1886 p5374, she was at the Forth and Clyde Hotel, Princes Street, Sydney. In the 1887 and 1888 annual lists she is at the Captain Cook Hotel, 33 Kent Street North, Sydney (NSW GG No 438 3 August 1887 p5075, No 416 10 August 1888 p5640) but in the annual list for 1889 Bridget Corcoran is the licensee and Louisa no longer holds a license in Sydney (NSW GG No 416 15 August 1889 pp5560, 5562).\n\nThe Publican\u2019s nameplate above the front door is not a matter of advertising but a legal requirement. The nameplate was required from 1882 on. \u2018An Act to remodel the law relating to Publicans and other Persons engaged in the sale of Liquor\u2019 [Assented to 19 December 1881] Act No.14 45 Vic (Short Title: Licensing Act of 1882), Section 77 required that \u2018Every licensee under this Act shall cause to be painted and shall maintain so painted in letters at least two inches long on the front of his premises his name in full followed by the words if he be the holder of a publican\u2019s license \u201clicensed to sell retail and spirituous liquors\u201d\u2026\u2019  \nThis also suggests that the licensee had to be kept the sign up to date or face legal action.\nJS", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-3810093173-72157627010227461", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "3810093173"}, "flarchive:created": 1389621735}
