I have a photo of my grandfather's Nash car. You can easily find photos of Nash cars on the web.\n\nI'm not sure if the third car is also a Nash car. It's proportions look a little different.\n\nAs far as the women's fashions go; the skirt length appears to be to the knee. During WW11 skirt hemlines were to the knee (through necessity to economise with fabric). After the war hemlines dropped to below the knee again, until the 1960s when hemlines were well above the knee; the mini skirt. \n\nThe skirt hemline in the 1930s was just below mid-calf. In the late 1940s it was just above mid-calf. The 1950s were generally just below the knee.\n\nTo have so many cars of the 1930s vintage in the photo doesn't make it look like the 1950s or 60s. \n\nCars in the 1940s were getting a rounded look as with the fourth vehicle.
