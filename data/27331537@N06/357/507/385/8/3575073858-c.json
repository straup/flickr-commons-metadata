All the buildings in the image are still there and still recognisable, with one exception. That is the second building from the right, which is no longer there. From the left, the Bank of Australia: not sure what it is now but definitely still very similar in structure. Then the building that now houses the ANZ Bank: this beautiful, old building seems absolutely unchanged, although paint job may be different. The obelisk is no longer there, though. I suspect that it may be the memorial to Henry Lawson, which is now in an area away from the centre of town. The building with the funny, little raised section on top is now the NAB, while the one on the far right with the clock tower is, I believe, occupied by the local newspaper. As to date, possibly late 40s to early 50s, judging by the vehicle on the right.", "authorname": "Wardie44B", "id": "27286215-3575073858-72157623429518238", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3575073858"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682573}
