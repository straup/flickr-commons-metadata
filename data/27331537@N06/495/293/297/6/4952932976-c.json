Following the closure of Pyrmont Bridge to vehicular traffic the eastern approach was demolished to make way for the Western Distributor. A pedestrian bridge was constructed over the distributor to link Pyrmont Bridge to Market Street. In 1987 a section of the monorail track was constructed across the Pyrmont Bridge. Further works at the eastern end of the bridge, in 1996, included the introduction of a pair of escalators and a set of stairs to the Cockle Bay promenade.\n\nref. <a href=\"http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_01_2.cfm?itemid=5053337\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_01_2.cfm?itemid=5053337</a>\n\nThis view is also useful:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_01_3.cfm?itemid=4500383&amp;imageid=4500948\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_01_3.cfm?itemid=4500383...</a>\n\nThere is a great deal of information about the history of the Western Distributor's construction here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/WesternDistributor/constructioninfo.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/WesternDistributor/constr...</a>\n\nBut it is difficult to discern which stage  may have altered the approach/exit to the Pyrmont Bridge, or even if there were significant changes before that.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "27286215-4952932976-72157624874017380", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4952932976/#comment72157624888100036", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1283736381", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeasdaddy] Comparing the original Corn Exchange Building with this wonderful rooftop to the modern version with the flat roof...it looks unfinished somehow.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Oops, thanks.", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-4952932976-72157624888100036", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4952932976/#comment72157624765798933", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1283765953", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeasdaddy] Thanks for all that information.  i don't think the stone balustrade is still there on the Sydney city side of the bridge; only on the Pyrmont side.
