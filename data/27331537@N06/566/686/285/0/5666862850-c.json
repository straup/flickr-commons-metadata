The 'Z' was reserved for locomotives which preceded the system's instigation (ie 2029 was a member of the former  E or 100 class which were built before 1924 and this class was unlikely to be repeated)\n\nThe 1924 system was the third classification system used by the NSW railways for their locomotive stock. The first simply used the number of the first loco in the class - ie No 1 loco belonged to the 1-class; the second used a letter (ie Locos 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65) formerly the 60-class became the O class, these were introduced in 1874 .For ease (?) the first two systems are sometimes combined so as to read the &quot;O-60  class&quot; or in the case above the &quot;E-100&quot; class.\n\nThis really gets confusing however as after the Second World War the NSWGR introduced another class called the &quot;AD60&quot; which was an articulated behemoth of a locomotive.", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-5666862850-72157626605065034", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5666862850/#comment72157626586098723", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1305292099", "_content": "So where was this photo taken ?
