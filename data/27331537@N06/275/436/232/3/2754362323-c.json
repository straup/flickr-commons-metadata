The Department may have given the image a different title from that used by the GPO. The titles used by the GPO reflect the job their client asked them to undertake. \n\nYes, Series 4481 is a great series, full of treasures. However the contents and their finding aids have a complex history which makes it difficult to identify these errors. We are grateful for the assistance we receive from our Flickr and Photo Investigator friends who not only correct errors but also explain exactly what can now be seen in the images. Contemporary viewers and the photographer had shared and assumed knowledge that they felt no need to record or explain.\n\nWe'd love to find a simple way to fix up corrections too. Using Flickr and Photo Investigator is our most efficient solution at the moment.\n\nWe have posted more contextual information for lovers of Series 4481 on our Archives Outside site:\n<a href=\"http://archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/uncovering-hidden-treasures-nrs4481-the-government-printing-office-collection/\" rel=\"nofollow\">archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/uncovering-hidden-trea...</a>\nJS", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-2754362323-72157627055823764", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2754362323"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681498}
