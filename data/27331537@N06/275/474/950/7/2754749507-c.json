The Goulburn Post Office was completed in1881 by F Horn and was officially opened by Postmaster General, Francis Bathurst Suttor. A public holiday was proclaimed in Goulburn to celebrate the opening. The post office cost \u00a316,000 (pound sterling) to construct. In addition, the Goulburn Telephone Exchange was opened in 1891.\n\nGoulburn Post Office is located in Auburn Street (former Hume Highway) in a precinct framed by other notable public buildings. The frontage to Auburn Street is symmetrical, dominated by a five-storey clock tower, flanked by two double-height arcades and terminated at each end with three-storey flanking pavilions. At each end there are two-storey wings covered in concrete tiles and fronted by a plain Italianate porch, which is set back from the pavilions. These provide additional entrances to the complex.\n\nThe tower has a central arched street entrance surrounded by rusticated stucco banding with a sculpted head of Queen Victoria, rusticated flanking voussoirs, a stepped reveal and battered base. It is topped by a plain frieze entablature with signage for the post office. A cornice indicates the first floor line and this is followed at the first tower floor level by a blind parapet moulding, broken by a balustrade of grouped circles below a central window. Evidently a central driveway to the rear yard went through the main arch in the clock tower's ground floor level, which has been replaced by part of the public hall.\n</blockquote>\nFrom - <a href=\"http://auspost.com.au/about-us/heritage-property-showcase.html#goulburn\" rel=\"nofollow\">auspost.com.au/about-us/heritage-property-showcase.html#g...</a>\n\nThe &quot;central driveway&quot; can be seen clearly in this photo.\n\nThe missing clock implies this is fairly close to 1881 - see reference to the Town Council shortly providing and placing in the tower - Australian Town and Country Journal 15/10/1881 p.32 (with illustration!) -  <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70961248\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70961248</a>.\n\nThe clock was in place by &quot;1885&quot; - <a href=\"http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/PhotoSearchItemDetail.asp?M=0&amp;B=3039104&amp;SE=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/PhotoSearchItemDetail.asp...</a>\nAnd &quot;1887&quot; - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?4481_a026_000532\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp...</a>\nTrying to narrow it down a bit more ...", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-2754749507-72157627673792181", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2754749507/#comment72157627673801545", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1317535357", "_content": "Now -\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johncowper/6197490452/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-2754749507-72157627673801545", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2754749507/#comment72157627674116871", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1317540047", "_content": "Details of the opening on Monday 3/10/1881 from SMH 4/10/1881 p.8 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13496061\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13496061</a>\n\nClock and campanile (?) were certainly there by 1885 - see this illustration in the Australian Town And Country Journal 3/10/1885 p.27  - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70984746\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70984746</a>\n\nSo this photo is 1881-85.
