This might enable us to date this pic a bit more precisely. Talk about research made easy!\n\n1) Some interesting background on this part of George Street - here's a news item on a fire which damaged the building owned by photographer Charles Lemaire (d. 1908) at 610 George St, in January 1880 - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28390014\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28390014</a> Here's a SMH report from 1887 on an action brought by Lemaire against his neighbour John Lawler, which indicates that Lawler had erected a building next to Lemaire's, and that this had involved the demolition of an earlier building known as Windsor House. The report also mentions that Lemaire had acquired 610 George St in 1877, had rebuilt after the 1880 fire, etc - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13650655\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13650655</a> There was also another larger fire in this part of George St in early September 1894 which gutted Lawler's Central Emporium (the 5 story building seen here) and damaged adjoining buildings...the first url here brings up a fantastic action pic of the fire from the T&amp;CJ - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71263718\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71263718</a>\n - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62964083\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62964083</a> \n\nI'm a bit puzzled by the numbering of Lemaire's and Lawler's buildings. Per the various newspaper items Lemaire's photographic studio was at 610 George St (you can see the numbering on Lemaire's sign in this pic), whilst Lawler's Central Emporium was at 608 George St. If this were the case, then Lemaire's building should be on the right side of Lawler's, not the left, as appears to be the case in this pic...maybe the buildings were renumbered at some point - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13966630\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13966630</a>\n\nIt's not entirely clear, but on the odd numbered side of George Street, the shop this side of Biddel Brothers' sign might be George Guyatt &amp; Co., surgical instrument maker. Various newspaper adverts have Guyatt's address as 495 George Street...Per the City of Sydney Assessment Book info Biddel Brothers were evidently at 505-507 - <a href=\"http://www3.photosau.com/CosRates/scripts/home.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www3.photosau.com/CosRates/scripts/home.asp</a>\n\n\n\n2) Re dating the photo - Draper Walter Long (d. 1898) appears to have been moving from 600 George St to new premises in ca. July-August 1887...see Long's advert which appeared in the SMH in July 1887, where he is seeking new premises (column c, 8th item in 'Houses Land &amp;tc Wanted') - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13657535\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13657535</a> ; also see this SMH item from August 1887, where 600 George St is advertised in the 'To Let' column (bottom of column b) - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13647092\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13647092</a>\n...this advert for a junior suggests that Long had moved to 327 George St by October 1888 (column d, 14th item from top) - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13700509\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13700509</a> Other items suggest that Long had moved on by February 1888 (column d, 4th item from bottom) - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13676310\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13676310</a>\n\nSo, going on Beachcomber's note (above) re the ornamental verandah, it would appear that this pic was taken after the erection of the ornamental verandah 1885, but prior to Walter Long's 'removal' (to use a quaint 19th century term), which took place between ca. July-August 1887 and February 1888.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "27286215-4312110541-72157628875032013", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4312110541/#comment72157628895143471", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1326720473", "_content": "Now here's an interesting pic! ...there's also an accompanying item on p.11 - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64035985\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64035985</a> Note how the wall with the Biddel Brothers' sign is here in shade!

December 1886 (possibly quite soon after...he hadn't yet found time to update his street number)...but some time before draper Walter Long's removal from 600 George St, which appears to have taken place between ca.
