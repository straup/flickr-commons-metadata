It was electric in operation, with the power being produced by two De Meritens magnetos weighing two and a half tons. These were driven by an eight-horse power &quot;Crossley - otto cycle&quot; silent horizontal coal gas engine at 830 rpm. Only one of the de Meritens generators is still in existence: it is owned by the Powerhouse Museum and on display at the Lighthouse. Likewise the original switchboard is owned by the museum but installed the Lighthouse. The Museum have one of the arc lamps, but it is not on display at either venue.\n\nThe electric apparatus was only used in bad weather. When the weather got really bad the second magneto was brought into operation producing a light of 6,000,000 candelas, the most powerful in the world at the time. In clear weather the illuminate was provided by a gas burner.&quot;\nMore here - <a href=\"http://www.lighthouse.net.au/lights/nsw/Macquarie/Macquarie.htm#History\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.lighthouse.net.au/lights/nsw/Macquarie/Macquarie.htm#...</a>\n\nc.1883", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-4312110687-72157623305950412", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4312110687/#comment72157623324913206", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1265001778", "_content": "Thanks for adding in this background and history of the lighthouse.", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-4312110687-72157623324913206", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4312110687/#comment72157623201284701", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1265014896", "_content": "I hope the Lighthouse and the Powerhouse Museum (who owns the engine) know about these wonderful pictures.

The current changer is employed for conversion of the electric current from half to full power, and vice versa.
