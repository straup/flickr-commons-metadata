Mr.Pullman's contract with the Commissioners is to provide 15 cars in all, 6 being of the description known as hotel cars, and. 9 of the kind known as &quot; sleepers &quot; Each hotel car will dine 46 persons at a sitting, and each sleeper afford accommodation for 32 passengers. The cars will be of the type known as the Pullman Vestibule Limited. The hotel cars, which are to be elaborately furnished, are said to cost \u00a36000 each, and the sleeping cars \u00a34000 .each.\n\nThe vehicles to be supplied to this colony will correspond in character with those running on the railways between New York and Chicago and will be furnished with an abundance of contrivances for securing the comfort of passengers. Not only is there to be a dining saloon, but almost all the other appointments of a well designed hotel, including drawing rooms, a social hall, furnished with a piano, smoking-rooms, bathrooms, lavatories, etc. The train will, be lighted throughout with electricity. Tho Commissioners.propose to have the Pullman cars in October next to convoy passengers to tho Melbourne races. Mr. Pullman however, expects to have all the vehicles in Sydney by next August.\n\nPassengers will welcome tho prospect of being able to enjoy the luxury of the luxury of the biggest name of the Pullman Palace Car, and their joy will be greatly increased when they realised - as we are informed by Mr. Pullman will be the case - that instead of having to pay 12s. 6d. each for a sleeping, berth to Albury they will not be required to pay more, than 8s a reduction of 4s 6d.
