The Portico on the south side or front, with four Grecian Pillars supporting a pediment and roof, forms the entrance, with doors leading into the Courts on either side.\nThe building surmounted by its Cupola and Lantern rising from the centre to a considerable height, forms a conspicuous object, visible from all parts of the City, and the Country for many miles round. The internal arrangements however, are both unsightly and incommodious, and anything {page 58} but realize the anticipations formed by the external appearance of the building. ... ...\n... The old Police Office was the building now used as the General Post Office, the present one not having been appropriated as such until about the year 1830. It is in contemplation to make some alterations and improvements in the interior of the present building, and we must confess, not before they are required, for it can hardly be expected that a building {page 59} erected for a Market House, and used for some time as a store, should be at all suitable for its present uses. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nEvidently Francis Greenway originally designed the building as a BUTTER MARKET - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13540611\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13540611</a> .\n\nThrough the 1880s the Sydney  Corporation were trying to redevelop the markets,  but the Police Court / Office was a Government building out of their control.
