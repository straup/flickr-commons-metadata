Dated by side mount spare sitting high, tear drop guards/fenders, headlights not fender mounted, and appears to have centre fabric turret (i.e. not all steel body). I\u2019d suggest a Holden-bodied GM car Buick, Chev, Pontiac or Olds, or a maybe 1936 Dodge. Nice bumper overriders too, also suggesting not an economy model.\n\nForeground Centre \u2013 I\u2019d suggest a 1933-34 (more likely \u201934) Ford De Luxe model \u2013 cowl mounted side lights, dual horns.
