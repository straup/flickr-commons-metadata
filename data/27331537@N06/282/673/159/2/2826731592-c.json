Nearly high enough for an adult to walk in and about as wide from memory.\nTrams terminated near the building in the left foreground, which could be the surf clubhouse.\nThe whole of the hill to the left is now fully developed with housing.\nSincerely, Bill", "authorname": "ArchivesOutside", "id": "27286215-2826731592-72157627212604479", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2826731592/#comment72157627265084063", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1312848511", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/48420463@N05] Thanks to Bill for sharing his memories here!\n\nAB", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-2826731592-72157627265084063", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2826731592"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681206}
