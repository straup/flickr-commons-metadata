The map shows that the main body of the King's Theatre, corner of George &amp; Harris streets behind the Agincourt Hotel, was aligned parallel to George Street, which is confirmed in aerial photos. There are no photos I am aware depicting the King's, other than a few in George Street after Hoyt's vacated the theatre. Designed by architect Clarence Backhouse only the first floor facade fronting George Street remains more or less unaltered although missing are two muses that stood on their plinths above where the McDonald's sign is now.", "authorname": "RAYCOPHONE", "id": "27286215-6075086408-72157632261743127", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6075086408"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619787}
