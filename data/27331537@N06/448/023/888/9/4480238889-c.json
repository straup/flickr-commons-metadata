I wonder if this photo has something to do with the opening?\n\nGoogle street view - <a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bathurst+station+nsw+&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=39.110235,77.255859&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bathurst&amp;ll=-33.419962,149.583213&amp;spn=0,359.981139&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-33.425163,149.582705&amp;panoid=OoQXz-Bcnxgx-gRo4jetaw&amp;cbp=12,137.89,,1,-2.83\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;...</a>\n\nWikipedia article - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_railway_station,_New_South_Wales\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_railway_station,_New_South...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-4480238889-72157623659808015", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4480238889/#comment72157624784992530", "realname": "Ian Sutton", "path_alias": null, "author": "22616984@N07", "iconserver": "7359", "datecreate": "1282521276", "_content": "<i>&quot;The opening of the Great Western Railway from the Metropolis to Bathurst, by the extension from Kelso to that place, was inaugurated here to day (April 4) in a most successful way, and with much ceremony.&quot;</i>\n<a href=\"http://newspapers.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18805310?searchTerm=bathurst+railway+station#pstart144779\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Maitland Mercury &amp; Hunter River General Advertiser (NSW : 1843-1893) Thursday 6 April 1876</a>", "authorname": "ibsut", "id": "27286215-4480238889-72157624784992530", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4480238889/#comment72157624786148688", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1282532192", "_content": "Thank you both for this information.
