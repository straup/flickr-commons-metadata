I see that the ferry directly under the bridge still has her tall steamer funnel. When new in 1938, and after wartime camouflage drab was removed in 1946, South Steyne's steel promenade deckhouse sides (upper deck) were painted a darkish brown to mimic the varnished teak of her doors and appear so in this picture. That colour became white with yellow/cream at window level in the mid 1950's and stayed that way to today. This picture is most likely c1950.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-3509062575-72157626692315463", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3509062575/#comment72157632603389181", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "90993042@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1359106794", "_content": "an interesting aside.....www.trove.nla.gov .au/    on Oct 3 1938 reports....&quot;Captain RM Beedle and Mr G.
