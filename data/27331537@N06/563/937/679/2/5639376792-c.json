He was a pensioner, and it is believed that be came down to receive his pension. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8595447555/\">William Hetzer</a> deposed that he was sitting on the onmibus when they were approaching the railway gate. He heard Charley, who was the driver, call out to deceased, who was near the gate, but instead of turning out of the way of the horses he went in their way. The horse struck the deceased, and forced him along; the driver turned the head of the leading horse to the left, but the deceased ran against him. The driver did everything in his power to prevent the deceased being run over. Mr. Hetzer thought that he felt the wheels of the omnibus pass over something, and so did his wife, who was in the body of the 'bus. The horses were going at the usual pace, and it was Mr. Hetzer's opinion that it was impossible to pull the horses up, so as to prevent the occurrence. From the evidence of James Higgs, head porter on the Sydney Railway Terminus, it appeared that the lamps on the gate were not lighted at the time. They are out of repair, and belong to the Corporation. Dr. Aitken deposed that the deceased had sustained severe injuries on the chest, such as must have caused instant death. Verdict, died from injuries received by being accidentally run over by an omnibus.</blockquote>\n\n<i>Empire</i>, Wednesday 3 April 1861, p. 8. - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60494465\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60494465</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5639376792-72157633107102835", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5639376792/#comment72157634394887414", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1372525742", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "27286215-5639376792-72157634394887414", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5639376792/#comment72157635023135839", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1376242772", "_content": "See also:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hwmobs/9472641326/][http://www.flickr.com/photos/27331537@N06] Digital ID: 17420_a014_a0140000255.jpg by chance?", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5639376792-72157635023135839", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5639376792/#comment72157635028034265", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1376266485", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet] Unfortunately not the image you're hoping for Here's a link to 17420_a014_a0140000255.jpg <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9318314986/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9318314986/</a>", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-5639376792-72157635028034265", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5639376792/#comment72157635037665510", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1376286751", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw] Well, I can't always be right! :) I didn't think of searching Flickr for the digital ID.
