This indicates there is a copy in the Marine Services Board (formerly Sydney Harbour Trust) glass plate collection. Although most of their collection were original, some were copies of existing photographs, which is likely to be the case here. Of course, maybe the glass plate got orphaned from the collection in the transfer to State Records and ended up in the Government Printing Office collection ...\n\nThis is Harvey Shore's caption: &quot;Woolloomooloo Bay in 1864. The progress of reclamation work is clear to see, and Cowper Wharf (the first in the area) is complete. There is hardly any development in the area, although the Municipal Fish Markets are just being built (left rear); these would stay in the 'Loo until the late 1890s. Sheehy's boatyard is in the foreground. The vessel anchored in the bay is a colonial barque, possibly the Woollahra.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13103618\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Tuesday 21 March 1865, p. 5.</a>: &quot;The most successful yacht builder, however, is Dan Sheehy, of Woolloomooloo Bay. His last vessel, the Xarifa, buillt for Mr. Parbury, is about as handsome a model as one would desire to see. He was also builder of the Blink Bonnie, also the Australian, a 6 ton open yacht; and the Sibyl, and Thought, 22 feet open boats, all of them winners. His work lies solely amongst pleasure yachts, and in this way himself and four men are constantly employed, and have been so for the past two years. He is about the only boatbuilder in this particular line of work.&quot;\n\nHarvey Shore credits Dan Sheehy with discovering the principle of streamlining in the hull design of yachts, but this is incorrect. He did build the boat, the Australian, but the design was Richard Harnett's. Harnett wrote of his design: &quot;I caught a mackerel in Woolloomooloo Bay for the purpose of obtaining correct lines. Opening its mouth, I cut the fish into two parts. Leaving the back, and laying the incised portion on a sheet of paper, I took for my load-waterline the horizontal lines of the fish, which were segments of a circle, the garboard strake corresponding with the waterlines and the midsection of a right-angled floor.&quot; - 'Picturesque Sydney Harbour' by Robyn Howard (Sydney : View Productions, 1984), p. 36.", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-4704298015-72157624592310409", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4704298015/#comment72157624721302766", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1281777024", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet]  Terrific find. 1864 it is (before the Cathedral fire - the gothic arch must have been showing due to the extensions under way?).\n\nMy thoughts are those gents are too smartly dressed for boat builders at work.
