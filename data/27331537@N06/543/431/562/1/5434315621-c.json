Trust me not to read the obvious! \n\nThe Great Zig Zag was opened on 18 October 1869 and the (G) 23 class, of which 34 was the twelfth member, entered service between September and October 1865. Thirteen were in service by December 1870 which would certainly date the picture from the earliest of days of this engineering marvel. This makes sense, as the final four of this class were fitted with 168 cm coupled wheels which made the handling of steeper grades - such as would be encountered on the Zig Zag the Blue Mountains, and the line around Picton - easier. The original nine of the class had 175 cm coupled wheels and reduced tractive effort.\n\nOne could conjecture, therefore, that the shot was taken during locomotive trials - hence the person at the rear of the train and the person looking up the line (although the same photograph in William a Bayley's book 'Lithgow  Zig Zag Railway'  [undated] describes the train as a &quot;tourist train&quot;). Either explanation is plausible.\n\nThe story of the (G) 23 class is an interesting one. Although they entered service as a 2-4-0 locomotive between 1865 and 1870, from 1890s they were transshipped from the workshops rebuilt as a 4-4-0 locomotive which completely altered their appearance!. They were then transferred to the south-western and far-western depots where there were few grades. \n\nThe last remaining member of the class (Z1405 - under the 1924 reclassification) was scrapped in June 1952 having travelled 1 866 880 km. Sadly none of the class remain \n\n(I'm grateful to Leon Oberg's book Locomotives of Australia for some additional information about the (G) 23 class.)", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-5434315621-72157626084296208", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5434315621/#comment72157625958907515", "realname": "John Cowper", "path_alias": "johncowper", "author": "21647809@N04", "iconserver": "7404", "datecreate": "1298080874", "_content": "I have now posted to my photostream pictures of both versions of the (G) 23 - (or Z14) class.
