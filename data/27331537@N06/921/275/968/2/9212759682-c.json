Possibly mid-week judging from the rather typical week-day crowd on the beach. This is very much the Manly in which I grew up! Sadly the harbour pool (the gift of the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company) was destroyed on the evening of 24 May 1974 when a huge storm and high tides lashed the area.\n\nSee Corinneski's picture here:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/corinneski/9159000750/]", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-9212759682-72157634498882519", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9212759682/#comment72157634519032530", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "33546386@N03", "iconserver": "2807", "datecreate": "1373141604", "_content": "Brilliant !", "authorname": "excellentzebu1050", "id": "27286215-9212759682-72157634519032530", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9212759682/#comment72157634538607122", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1373237490", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johncowper] That looks like a mighty big storm - scary stuff!", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-9212759682-72157634538607122", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9212759682/#comment72157634601395191", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1373624572", "_content": "So Michael's arch and Michael's cave are not the same thing.

Most of the buses have highly contrasting colours, which would suggest the older red and cream livery. Only a couple are in the new green and cream (which didn't contrast as much in B&amp;W photos). The last red repaints were in September 1946 with a big effort to start green repaints the following month. My gut feeling is the photo is from the summer of 1946-47.\n\nThe funnels give the ferry away as either the SS Dee Why or SS Curl Curl.", "authorname": "David Bromage", "id": "27286215-9212759682-72157634782663049", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9212759682/#comment72157634854022499", "realname": "", "path_alias": "corinneski", "author": "21624712@N07", "iconserver": "6039", "datecreate": "1375185546", "_content": "mich_sydney, it certainly was a very big storm and extremely scary.
