The line was single track from Taronga Zoo top gate to Athol Wharf, with one crossing loop - Ashton Loop. The tram was lifted out of the water by the Maritime Services Board tug 'Sampson', which is a crane. The tram was then taken over to Pyrmont, where it was loaded onto Pittmans trailer (contractor) and taken to Randwick Workshops. The tram was repaired and overhauled, returning back to service on 22-3-1954.", "authorname": "dunedoo", "id": "27286215-6218525645-72157627773230793", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6218525645"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619707}
