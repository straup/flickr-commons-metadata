Interestingly the next tunnel &quot;Redbank&quot; after this &quot;Picton&quot; tunnel about 2 km toward Thirlmere has just been bypassed by a significant re-route of the main Southern Line around the hill due to Xstrata's Long Wall mine subsidence. Apparently XStrata paid for this but the old tunnel has been very meticulously erased by a huge landscaping effort and is now difficult to spot. This coincides with the relatively nearby Pheasant's Nest freeway viaduct being braced a few years ago due to the same mine subsidence.\nVarious monitoring points exist along both the freeway and the main southern line to monitor the problem.
