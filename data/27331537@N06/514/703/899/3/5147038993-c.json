This locomotive marshalled trains for despatch to the NSW Government Railways. This locomotive was an &quot;0-6-0&quot; wheeled type. (Author's note: This locomotive appears to me to have been an &quot;Avonside&quot; built vehicle). After Greta Colliery closed in the early 1900's, this locomotive was purchased by the Portland Cement Company Limited and transferred to their sidings.</a>", "authorname": "ibsut", "id": "27286215-5147038993-72157625190570847", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5147038993"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620561}
