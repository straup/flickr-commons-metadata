Sterling</i> and <i>Helen B. Sterling</i> - DH after his daughter and HB after his wife (there had already been an earlier 4-masted schooner <i>Helen B. Sterling</i> lost at sea in 1922). In May 1926 he bought the <i>Hawaii</i> and named her <i>Ethel M. Sterling</i> after his daughter-in-law:\n\n\u201cShe was sold to Captain E.R. Sterling, of Seattle, in May 1926, who installed two 240 horsepower diesel engines. During this conversion, she retained her masts but lost her sails and bowsprit and became a \u2018bald-headed four-masted schooner\u2019. She was renamed the \u2018Ethel M. Sterling\u2019 after his daughter-in-law. The Ethel M. Sterling plied the trade routes until she was seized in San Francisco in September 1927, as her owners had never paid for the engines. The ship was subsequently sold to a woman in Los Angeles for use as a tender in the tuna trade. Proving too big for the job, she was sold again to the Santa Fe Mercantile Company and used for lumber movements. Sold once more to Mexican owners in 1933, she was fully converted to a powered motor boat and lost her masts.\u201d \nInteresting reading her life story which ends as a rice ship (W. Lawson, Shipwrecks of the Cayman Islands, Aquapress, 2004).

Sterling</i>, ex-<i>J. M. Weatherwax</i>), purchased by ER in 1916 and operated under the command of RM Sterling. \n\nThen of course there was also a Margaret F. Sterling!  Ex-<i>Vancouver</i>, she was \u201cthe last of the famous fleet of Sterling multi-masted schooners which met with a remarkable series of misfortunes in the Australian trade\u201d. A 4-masted schooner, MF was later renamed <i>Trade Wind</i> and converted to a floating base ship for the NZ service of Pan-American Airways.\n\nI kayaked past the wreck of the Dorothy H.
