I would say this is what covered the old Devonshire Street, the pedestrian tunnel now below this area. The building with the tram was parrallel (east-west) and fronting what was Devonshire Street, and the new (current) Central Station was way off the the right of the new tracks.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-5889052333-72157632149771268", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5889052333/#comment72157634458972352", "realname": "Jonathan Berry", "path_alias": "highranger", "author": "86916510@N00", "iconserver": "7306", "datecreate": "1372827768", "_content": "Now \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/highranger/9194485455/\">www.flickr.com/photos/highranger/9194485455/</a>", "authorname": "Highranger", "id": "27286215-5889052333-72157634458972352", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5889052333"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619908}
