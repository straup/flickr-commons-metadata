The present building does NOT have this kink, so it does not match up with 368, instead there is a now 1 metre \u201cstep\u201d between these buildings, which can be plainly seen on Google street view.\n368-370 is possibly the 1930 building with an extra floor added.\n372-374 is most likely the existing building, it has an ornate  fa\u00e7ade above the awning which cannot be seen in the 1930 photo possibly because it\u2019s painted white.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/97539983@N07/10155128535/]", "authorname": "Shire Mike", "id": "27286215-9812763993-72157636314432776", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9812763993/#comment72157636504315996", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1381678742", "_content": "It is definitely looking from west towards east, yes", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-9812763993-72157636504315996", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9812763993/#comment72157636528952443", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1381723219", "_content": "Wow - excellent sleuthing everyone - title is now updated!", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-9812763993-72157636528952443", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "9812763993"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618086}
