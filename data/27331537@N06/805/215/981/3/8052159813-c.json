But there are lots of people on the beach,  so it wasn't taken at 5 AM or some funny time.   I can't see any trams or buses anywhere either.    Kalajzich's hotel is not built.  There are a few cars parked on the side of the road, but none moving anywhere,  which seems a bit odd.   I can't see any of the 1960's-70's era style units.   The Harbord Diggers is just out of shot.  Can't see any tram tracks.  The absence of cars seems so strange,  I am wondering if it is some unusual time,  like 11 AM on Armistice Day,   or during the running of the Melbourne Cup or maybe Christmas Day.\nSome expert will know about the various configurations of the wharves at Manly.\nThe height of the trees on the ocean-side waterfront might also be a clue.   I know there was a big die-off due to detergent in the sewage  in the late 70's but the photo is well before that.\nI will guess 1939.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-8052159813-72157631725341470", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8052159813/#comment72157631763261212", "realname": "Don Shearman", "path_alias": "donshearman", "author": "18901029@N00", "iconserver": "96", "datecreate": "1350178722", "_content": "Manly Oceanworld is not there, so definitely before 1962.
