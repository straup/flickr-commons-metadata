One example in this photo; you can see the northern lagoon before the environmental vandals turned it into a car park and the creek into an open sewer (though the latter is much better since the installation of the new sewerage system). Thankfully, the same never happened to Marely Lagoon, nicely protected in the Royal.  Perhaps the changes are not all for the worse. There has been considerable regrowth of native trees in the gullies including gully rainforest species. But the sad part of that story is the understory; it is often mostly lantana, blackberry and other noxious weeds. On matters of regrowth, in this photo the buttresses to the southern escarpment are well timbered, but the tall timber on the most exposed ridge was killed by wildfires some 50 odd years ago, and it is only relatively recently that this has been allowed to regenerate with the removal of the cattle grazing these slopes.  Love this place and love this photo.
