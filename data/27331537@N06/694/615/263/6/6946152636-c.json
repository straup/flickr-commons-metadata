The trolley bus is about to turn into Geeves Avenue towards Rockdale Railway Station. The Seven Ways on the right is the road which goes over the railway line towards Bexley. Bay Street is to the left. At the corner of Bay Street is the Bank of New South Wales (later Westpac) with the shoe store next door. At the right is the Commonwealth Bank. The Odeon Theatre is just behind the bus on the eastern side of the Princes Highway. The building is no longer there. I remember seeing movies like 'The King and I' there in the 1960s with my family. From the Theatres and Public Halls file <a href=\"http://api.records.nsw.gov.au/items/35323\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the Odeon Theatre, Rockdale</a> operated from around 1921 to at least 1969. The trolley bus ran from Sans Souci to Kogarah and then on to Rockdale from 1937 to 1959 so this photo was taken towards the end of the trolley bus service.", "authorname": "Janette Pelosi", "id": "27286215-6946152636-72157629873047679", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6946152636/#comment72157629948408421", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1335965597", "_content": "There used to be a Holden dealer down near where that theatre is.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-6946152636-72157629948408421", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6946152636/#comment72157630241786036", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "80987958@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1340401798", "_content": "the double decker type bus had two sets of stairs to get to the top deck when i was a youhg boy my mates and i used this stairs system to dodge paying the conductor our penny for ticket", "authorname": "daddydragon 60", "id": "27286215-6946152636-72157630241786036", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6946152636/#comment72157631631850687", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "87781339@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1348703474", "_content": "This photograph is actually taken from Tramway Arcade.
