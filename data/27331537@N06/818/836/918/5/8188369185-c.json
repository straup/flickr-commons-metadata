Princes Street - now completely lost to the Bradfield Highway. As are those steps leading up to it. Looks like the Cut was also widened when the highway went in.\n2. Cumberland Street - this still has a bridge over the cut, though it is not arched as per this picture\n3. Gloucester Street - Gloucester Street now no longer makes it as far as Argyle St - so no need for a bridge!\n\nSee [http://www.flickr.com/photos/noctorum/8199274598/in/photostream]", "authorname": "noctorum", "id": "27286215-8188369185-72157632055905536", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8188369185/#comment72157632136122614", "realname": "Jonathan Berry", "path_alias": "highranger", "author": "86916510@N00", "iconserver": "7306", "datecreate": "1354247268", "_content": "What was the story with the &quot;unfinished&quot; block work? it has since been altered and cleaned up.\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/?ll=-33.858603,151.205446&amp;spn=0.003831,0.007398&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-33.858582,151.205258&amp;panoid=WINLTMLDA3wGRdo0PS8Yow&amp;cbp=12,94.17,,0,0\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/?ll=-33.858603,151.205446&amp;spn=0.00383...</a>", "authorname": "Highranger", "id": "27286215-8188369185-72157632136122614", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8188369185/#comment72157632891019087", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "63385174@N06", "iconserver": "5469", "datecreate": "1362199737", "_content": "The intention must have been to extend the church west at some later stage.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-8188369185-72157632891019087", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8188369185"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618846}
