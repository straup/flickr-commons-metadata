By 1860, the Blaxlands had lost control of the estate.  By 1863, Newington was very run down, although the slaughterhouse and the saltpans were both still in use. At this time, ten hectares of land including Newington House were leased to the Methodist Church for use as a boys\u2019 boarding school on the understanding that the rent from the first five years of occupancy would be used for repairs to the buildings.  \nIt was in July 1863 that nineteen pupils were admitted to the school. This humble beginning was the genesis of Newington College. By 1880, the College began the move to its present address in Stanmore, an inner-city western suburb of Sydney. Newington College on its Stanmore campus was officially opened on 15 January 1881. Newington Estate was eventually sold to John Wetherill in 1877 for \u00a314,000. He subdivided the property into the Newington and Rosebridge Estates and was selling land for the next twenty years.  \nIn 1879, Newington House was offered for sale by auction but remained unsold although as early as June 1860, James Barnet, the Colonial Architect, reported on the house and buildings and concluded that it was suitable for a boys\u2019 reformatory or a benevolent asylum for aged/destitute women that was then located at Hyde Park Barracks. He recommended that lots 78, 79, 87 and 88 of the Newington Estate should be purchased. In September 1879 a payment of \u00a35,000 was made to Wetherill and <b>by 1880 Newington House became Government property</b>.  \nIn 1883, Newington House was opened as a Benevolent Asylum for Aged Women. Between 1912-18 buildings were added and the function of the facility changed from asylum to a state hospital with Newington House at one time being used as nurses\u2019 quarters. In 1969, the house became the administration block within the Silverwater Correctional Complex. ... .... &quot;\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.afloat.com.au/afloat-magazine/2009/january-09/John_Blaxland#.UjVyJcakyjA\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.afloat.com.au/afloat-magazine/2009/january-09/John_Bl...</a>\n\nSo it seems that this photo is after 1880.  \nThere is an 1895 photo which shows the two palm trees at similar heights -  <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an3366506-s70-a1\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an3366506-s70-a1</a>.\nBy 1922 the palm trees were taller - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an2726970\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an2726970</a>\nAnd by the time of this photo, the vegetation was winning - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=206419\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=206419</a>\nSo possibly <b>c.1895</b>.
