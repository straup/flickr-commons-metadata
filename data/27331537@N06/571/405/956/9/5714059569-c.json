They don't have a steel tape measure 2000 metres long,  and even if they did,  they can't measure it across the harbour.\nBut they do have a steel tape measure 500 metres long,   and a big lawn at Government house.  So they mark out 2 points in the garden at Government house,   and they know exactly the distance between them with their steel tape measure.   They they measure the angles to C and D.  After they do this,  they can use trigonometry to measure the exact distance between C and D  so they know how long to make the bridge.\nThe description that they needed to do this to lay out the centreline from C to D is not an accurate description in my opinion.   They had C and D laid out.  The purpose of this rigmarole was to determine the exact distance from C to D.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-5714059569-72157626710626610", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5714059569/#comment72157626591706583", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1305364320", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mich2009] mich_sydney_2007 Thank you.
