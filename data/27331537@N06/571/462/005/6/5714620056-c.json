Here is an excerpt:\n\n&quot;...Trial Bay had been recognised as a safe shipping refuge from southerlies ever since its naming after the wreck of the Brig Trial in 1817. In the 19th century, coastal shipping was the main means of transport. Between 1863 and 1866 some 90 ships and 243 lives were lost, forcing the NSW Colonial government to act. In 1870 Parliament voted 10,000 pounds towards the construction of a breakwater to form a \u201charbour of safe refuge\u201d at Trial Bay.\n...The Trial Bay Gaol was established in 1876 as an experimental Public Works Gaol where the inmates would construct the breakwater...not completed until 1886...&quot;", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-5714620056-72157626729547834", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "5714620056"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619998}
