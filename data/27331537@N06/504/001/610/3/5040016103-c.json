They suffered many delays during construction - mostly due to the Second World War. 3801 was the first engine completed and entered service in January 1943. The last in the class, 3830 entered service in November 1949. \n\n3809 was built at the New South Wales Government Railway Workshops at Cardiff in Newcastle.\n\nBy 1951 diesel locomotives started appearing on the rails of NSW. These gradually took the &quot;glamour workings&quot; away from the 38 class, who would be confined to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. They could still be found working The Newcastle Flyer up until December 1970.[..", "authorname": "myhappypenguin", "id": "27286215-5040016103-72157630253508558", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5040016103"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620682}
