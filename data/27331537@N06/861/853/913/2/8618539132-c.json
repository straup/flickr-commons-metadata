The house which was called &quot;Feslenberg&quot; (ie. rock mountain) [see <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/63240308\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Empire</i>, Friday 1 December 1865, p. 1</a>], was situated on John Street (later renamed Edward Street), Peacock Point, Balmain. The house was previously known as &quot;Prospect Cottage&quot; [see <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60484460\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Empire</i>, Saturday 14/09/1861, p. 1</a>].\n\n<blockquote>While the Degotardi house admittedly still enjoyed its prospect over the bay to Observatory Hill, its new name no doubt derived from the rocky, in fact even perilous cliff edge which abutted the Degotardis' garden. (Fletcher, p. 66)</blockquote>\n\nThe block of land Degotardi bought in 1859, lot 10, was &quot;wedged between&quot; (Fletcher, p. 65) Chape's Wharf and Edwin Beckmann, watchmaker, his immediate neighbour to the south on lot 9. Both lots commanded views of Observatory Hill (Fletcher, p. 48).\n\n1888 map - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_zoomify/2008/D00663/a1367035.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_zoomify/2008/D00663/a1367035.html</a>\n1896 map - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_zoomify/2008/D00663/a1367036.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_zoomify/2008/D00663/a1367036.html</a>\n\nAnd yes, it means this panoramic view was taken perhaps literally from his back garden, or very close to it, and is almost certainly by John Degotardi, a specialist in panoramic views.
