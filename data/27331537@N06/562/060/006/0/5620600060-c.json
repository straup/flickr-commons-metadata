The staff of the Sydney Harbour Bridge Branch of the Department of Public Works travelled on the same ship as the 1924 Australian Olympic team. Clearly the streamers and crowds are for the Olympic team, and people were not as enthusiastic about the preparation of the Bridge's drawings, contracts and specifications as we thought.\n\nI would suggest that [SRNSW 12685_a007_a00704_8722000089r] is Kathleen Marion Butler, the secretary of John Job Crew Bradfield. She and Messrs Stuckey, Holt and Powys, technical officers, were sent to London to check the working drawings and specifications of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that were being prepared by the contractor Dorman Long. There are a number of photographs of her in Richard Raxworthy's <i>The Unreasonable Man: the life and works of J J C Bradfield</i> but usually at a distance and with her cloche hat shading her face.\n\nThe staff's trip to London is described on the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 June, 1925, page 75: 'On 30th April, 1924, a staff consisting of Miss K M Butler, secretary, and Messrs Stuckey, Holt and Powys, technical officers, in accordance with the conditions of the specification and contract agreement were sent to London to check the plans, calculations, etc. On 30th July, 1924, the Chief Engineer (i.e. John Job Crew Bradfield) left for London to finalise the work of the staff and to sign the plans. The staff left London in November, 1924, via Canade and the United States, reaching Sydney on 10th January, 1925'.
