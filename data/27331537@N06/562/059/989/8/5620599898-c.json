(The original 48 class which were built as tank engines, and later converted to tender engines and formed the 23N-class and saw service in the Hunter region). \n\nThe number is a little unclear but it looks like No 55  - if so it entered service in May 1874 and was withdrawn from service in 1892 having travelled 530,060 miles. The locomotive was imported from R Stephenson and Company and  erected by Mort and Company, Sydney.\n\nAccordingly would suggest you change the caption to Class (2nd) 48 No 55 locomotive", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-5620599898-72157626375849061", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5620599898/#comment72157632140665141", "realname": "John Cowper", "path_alias": "johncowper", "author": "21647809@N04", "iconserver": "7404", "datecreate": "1354360876", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/27331537@N06] Pssst State Records -- you haven't changed the caption yet.
