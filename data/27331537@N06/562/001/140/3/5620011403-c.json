Each escalator will be four feet wide, of the reversible type, will be driven by an electric motor, will have a travelling speed of 90 feet per minute, and will have a capacity of 9000 to 10,000 passengers per hour ... Escalators, or moving stairways, are a simple, safe, and very effective method of passenger transportation from one level to another without any effort on the part of the passenger. When the passenger reaches the top or bottom of his journey he simply walks away. Escalators are in common use on railway stations in New York and London and other up-to-date cities, whilst they have been installed in many large drapery stores in the United States and Japan.'  - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16053931\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16053931</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5620011403-72157626581659924", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5620011403/#comment72157626462180673", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1303858906", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet] Thanks for adding this...simple instructions for using an escalator!\n\nAB", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-5620011403-72157626462180673", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5620011403/#comment72157626935503782", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1307796775", "_content": "It was important information - they were the <b>first escalators</b> in Australia!
