The 'Queen's Avenue' was designed as a memorial to Victoria and the decorations are accordingly muted. The memorial wreath, 15 feet wide, with the words 'Victoria the Good' hung across King Street and was made of everlasting flowers. Wreaths from NSW country towns hung from garlands strung between the venetian masts topped with silver crowns. The bunting was a suitable mourning colour of purple.

They sure loved their parades and decorations in those days! But the opening of the Federal Parliament was pretty special! And what a great idea creating a street as a memorial to the late Monarch - King Street no less.
