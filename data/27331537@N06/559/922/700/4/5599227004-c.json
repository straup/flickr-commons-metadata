I like his sentiment expressed in a letter to the editor ... THE RAILWAY STATION OPENING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. - &quot;<i>those who have been complaining of the delays in the late emergency should have thought of what they had to thank the raliway enthusiasts of 1855 for, and the care the Railway Commissioners, their officers, and men were at that very moment taking to ensure their safety. As I looked over the railway station and witnessed the great work of removing buildings and laying down fresh lines, many men working day and night, I could not help wondering how any traveller could allow a murmur to escape his lips. Instead of finding fault we should rather congratulate the Railway Department for its wonderful success.</i>&quot; - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14792510\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 13 August 1906, p.4.</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5599227004-72157626453326916", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5599227004/#comment72157626328686811", "realname": "John Cowper", "path_alias": "johncowper", "author": "21647809@N04", "iconserver": "7404", "datecreate": "1302257583", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/47201412@N02] Yes, Charles was my great grandfather, at the time he was retired, having been the NSW Sheriff and Water Police Magistrate - they lived on Cockatoo Island during my grandfather's schooldays.
