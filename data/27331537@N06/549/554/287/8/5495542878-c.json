The council decided to strip a street or two back to their  base, after many years of laying bitumen over bitumen. (I don't know which streets they were but).\nI remember truck loads of old wood blocks, covered in bitumen being dumped in the Wattle Street yard.\nThis was the first time I found out, that this was how the the steerts were paved in the earlier days.\nIn winter, while working in the open, we use to burn these wooden blocks in open drums.\nOne of the workmates took some home, and paved  his driveway with them.\nI wish now, I would have done the same.
