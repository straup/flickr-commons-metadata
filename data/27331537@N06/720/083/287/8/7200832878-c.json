Also,  by 1960 I think the Fort Macquarie tram depot had been demolished,    and it is still quite visible in this photo.    Observing the alignment of Fort Denison and the end of the cliff at the end of th gardens suggests that the photo is taken on top of what is now the Museum of Contemporary Art.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-7200832878-72157630087621682", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7200832878/#comment72157638470507185", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92723869@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1386506559", "_content": "This photo was taken from the MSB building with a corner of the new Stage 2 construction visible above the bow of the ship docked at the terminal.

Having now checked SMH via Trove for shipping movements, the Tregothnan was in port several times during 1950 &amp; 1951, but was tied up at Circular Quay only once, that being during March, 1950. It arrived from London on the 12th March and sailed for Brisbane in the a.m. of Sat 1 April. Therefore this dates our photo to mid- to late March 1950.
