The George Street tramway had a soft opening with no ceremony on 8 December 1899 ( <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14260902\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14260902</a> ).  After that time there would have been trams everywhere;  they ran every few minutes and helped rid the streets of horse-drawn buses, still evident in this picture.  \nSeveral other Tyrrell Collection photos have turned up on Flickr showing George Street with tram lines, poles, and wires, but no trams.  Were they taken as a record of pre-tramway traffic about December 1899?\n\nAlso not evident here is the Sydney Harbour Trust building (opened 1903) about to be built behind the Anthony Hordern advertisement, in front of the Fire Station.   \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2715092837/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2715092837/</a>.  It would have taken at least a year to build.\nNeither is any demolition of slums in The Rocks apparent; surely a sign this is before 1900?\n\nSimilar view about 10 years later (1909?) -  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/patopostcards/2170520985/\">www.flickr.com/photos/patopostcards/2170520985/</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-4828624758-72157624510261055", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4828624758/#comment72157624538258327", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1281058520", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Yes, you are right, again!
