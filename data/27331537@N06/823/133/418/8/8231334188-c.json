Relevant bit top of column 8,  including this delightful anecdote - \n\n<blockquote>\n&quot; ...  As the Royal visitors were leaving the pavilion for the pontoon Captain Jessen, of the  Russian warship, bid them bon voyage according to the national custom by presenting rye bread and salt. A silver cellar placed in the middle of the bread held the salt, and bore on one side the engraving, &quot; God speed and a pleasant voyage,&quot; and on the other &quot;Gromoboi, Sydney Harbour.&quot;   The token was also accompanied  by a huge basket of flowers from the Russian warship. The gallant captain, in making the presentation, kissed the hand of the  Duchess, but by a mischance his cap fell, and some of the salt was knocked on the carpet.  A barge manned by bluejackets was waiting at the pontoon, and their Royal Highnesses  \nimmediately stepped aboard.   As they were rowed to the Ophir a parting cheer was given, the band of the R.A.A. played the National Anthem, and then the crowds watched with keen interest the preparations being made on the harbour for the departure of the Ophir.  ... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd the weather - \n\n<blockquote>\n&quot; ... It was a boisterous day. Wind blew strongly from the land, making crisp choppy wavelets on the surface of the harbour, flecked with foam. The looser rigging of the ships was blown out in bows, whilst the bunting borne by them was distended and straining to get away. There was a great sense of what painters call atmosphere in the outlook, due to the aerial disturbances. ... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nThe two attending gunboats were sister ships 'Karrakatta' and 'Boomerang' - see notes - I am not 100% sure if I have them the right way around.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-8231334188-72157632156662675", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8231334188/#comment72157632161133540", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1354529876", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] &quot;crisp choppy wavelets on the surface of the harbour&quot; ...
