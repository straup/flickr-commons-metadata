Checking images of said model reveals that the headlights are either mounted on a tube running horizontally from the bonnet to the mudguard, or mounted directly at an angle of roughly 45\u00ba to the mudguard. The vehicle in the photo seems to be mounted directly to the mudguard in a vertical manner, which suggests it might be a Rover 12 of similar vintage &amp; appearance to the Daimler. Difficult to tell not knowing either vehicle intimately!", "authorname": "juantoo34", "id": "27286215-7947847398-72157638313703554", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7947847398"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619015}
