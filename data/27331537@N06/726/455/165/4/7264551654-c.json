Maybe a traffic historian might be able to tell us when angle parking (or perpendicular parking) for horses was introduced.\n\nThe telegraph poles appear to be the older no cross-arm type - <a href=\"http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/cbd/cbd3-003.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sydneyarchitecture.com/cbd/cbd3-003.htm</a>\n\nAre the horse and cart parked in ?
