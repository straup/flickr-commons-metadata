The images cover the area of The Rocks that was gazetted for resumption in the NSW Government Gazette No.1203 on 29 December 1900, pp10123-4, under the the Darling Harbour Wharves Resumption Act 1900 (Act No.10, 1900).\n\nState Records holds, as part of NRS 4481, the original 8 inch x 10 inch glass plate negatives from which these direct contact prints were made in the 1970s.\n\nIt is thought that the negatives in the Tyrrell Collection are copy negatives because the images appear two to a plate.
