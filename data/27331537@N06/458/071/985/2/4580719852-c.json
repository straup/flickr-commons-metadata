Most of those buildings in the left distance were resumed and demolished soon after this photo (1904). The 'white'  building is Boylan's Hotel on the site of its replacement, the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel.  The steep ramp on to the new Pyrmont Bridge is just in front of the gabled building at far left.  The wharf buildings are a new wheat storage and loading wharf.  Evidently there was a bumper crop in 1903.   The chimney belongs to the Pyrmont Power Station (not Ultimo), and acrobat Melvin Vaniman photographed a panorama looking the reverse direction from the top of the chimney in December 1903, presumably just before it started belching smoke.\n\nVaniman panorama (which makes sense of my rant) - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemPopLarger.aspx?itemid=412343\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemPopLarger.aspx?itemid=412343</a> , \nand State Library blurb - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=412343\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=412343</a> .\n\n1895 Map of area - <a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-rm3443-sd&amp;rgn=0.2431875792,0.3196589076,0.3382446134,0.3887992625&amp;width=1200&amp;cmd=zoomout\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-rm3443-sd&amp;rgn=0...</a>\n\nAnother contemporary photo of the background Pyrmont to compare buildings with Zoomit - <a href=\"http://from.ph/28399\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.ph/28399</a>\n\nThere are several pictures available via a &quot;Darling island&quot; search on Trove, showing these warehouses stacked with grain sacks as are being loaded in Photo 1.   \n\nI think the &quot;Sol&quot; was transporting the Government photographer (was it John Degotardi Jnr?).

The photographer was near  &quot;Ballarat Park&quot; as marked on Google Maps, looking (almost) south - <a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Sydney+New+South+Wales&amp;ll=-33.868082,151.198826&amp;spn=0.010066,0.01929&amp;z=16\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com.au/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Sydney+...</a>  .  That is about 1km or 1/2 a mile from Pyrmont Bridge.\n\nThe Vaniman panorama (link above) shows this clearly imho.  The old 1895 map shows some of the old features.  The Powerhouse Museum photo is great for identifying buildings like Boylan's Hotel.\n\nWhile this may confuse further, here is another (1905) map of the area (upside down S-N) - it shows a couple of wharfs in Pyrmont Bay which were not built at the time of this photo, but also the railway lines on Darling Island-  <a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-f115-sd&amp;rgn=0.5084241824,0.4895389384,0.8057482656,0.7220069740&amp;width=1200&amp;cmd=zoomout\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-f115-sd&amp;rgn=0.5...</a>\n\nI too thought it was Darling Harbour towards Railway Square, but could not reconcile those buildings in the background.
