For eighty years up to the 1970s, Goulburn was the establishment within the NSW penal system with a particular role in the reformation of first time and young offenders. It had a long history of agricutural and industrial training and education and built up a strong economic and social association with the town of Goulburn (Kerr 1994: iv). \nThe plan for the complex was developed in 1879, in J. Barnet's office under the supervision of William Coles (State Projects 1995; Kerr 1994). It was built by Frederick Lemm of Sydney between 1881 and 1884 at a cost of sixty-one thousand pounds. The new gaol was part of the public works boom in the town during the 1869 - 86 period and boosted employment as well as local industry (State Projects 1995). In 1893 a new wing was added and in 1894, a range of cells were constructed for female prisoners. Areas for agricultural cultivation were introduced in 1897-1899 and a bakery was constructed in 1916.&quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-6439128979-72157628245163739", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6439128979/#comment72157628245262789", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1322824707", "_content": "'Completion of the Goulburn Gaol' article in the SMH 6/8/1883 p.6 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13541089\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13541089</a> .
