That's typical of the 'big' Toyota Crown about 1960 (pre-Corona) that began to be sold in the US in 1959 as a 'Toyopet Crown.'  There's a second one in the same area, farther back, just look for the crease at the rear wheel.\n\nI think I see a Fiat 1100 in the center of the photo just to our left of the Austin Noted above.\n\nRegarding the big car at the lower left, I'm thinking it is a 1961 Pontiac (USA).\n\nThese would have been available in the US and Canada around 1 October, 1960.
