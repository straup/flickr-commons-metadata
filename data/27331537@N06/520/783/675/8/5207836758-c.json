Subsequently, a lengthy Royal Commission in 1891 recommended two stations: a terminal station at the Benevolent Asylum site to the north of Devonshire Street for long distance trains; and a station in Hyde Park facing King Street for suburban trains, with a branch to the eastern suburbs.\n\nThe 1890s Depression put a stop to any action being taken on new stations at this time. The subsequent Railway Commissioner made a strong request for a new station in 1896 and this led to yet another Royal Commission in 1896/97 on the City Railway. This Royal Commission concluded that having two separate terminal stations would be impractical, and recommended a single larger station at the Hyde Park site facing St James Road. However, with public opposition to the loss of parkland and with a change of government in 1899, the St James Road scheme was abandoned.\n\nInterestingly, the first reference to Central Station appears to have come from an initial report of the Royal Commission into this scheme.  <b>[maybe explains this 'faulty' title?]</b>\n\nThe abandoning of the St James Road scheme was much to the disappointment of the Railway Commissioner. In 1900, State Parliament accepted a compromise solution that was the brainchild of the then Minister for Public Works, E.W. O'Sullivan. He proposed that a new station be built just north of Devonshire Street, a stone's throw from the existing terminus.\n\nHowever, to both commuters and the Railway Commissioner, it did not constitute a City railway extension.  &quot;\nfrom - <a href=\"http://www.cityrail.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cityrail.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-5207836758-72157626309078003", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5207836758/#comment72157626319878049", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1302133174", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Imagine how much noisier Sydney would be if Central Station was at Hyde Park!
