The spot, he says, is a very hotbed of disease germs. Throughout the winter a heavy nauseating vapour defines the locality, and during the summer months the exhalations are poisonous.

Some did more than attend meetings and sign petitions - to ruin the gardens was said to be a favourite Sunday pastime. At least one local was appalled and wrote to the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> in 1879:\n\nTHE CHINESE AGAIN - TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD.\n<i>Sir, - I wish to call the attention of the police authorities to what appears to be a systematic persecution, by a number of larrikins. on a few poor Chinese who have a market garden situated between Rushcutter Bay and the Glenmore Road, and of part of which persecution I was an eyewitness, last Saturday afternoon.\nThese noble-souled youths came down in a body upon these poor gardeners (one of whom is just recovering from a severe illness) with yells and whoops, and the foulest of foul language, hurling stones upon the roof of their dwelling, and at the men who were enraged and driven to desperation, not knowing what to do or where to turn to get redress, seeming too very fearful of making any complaint, and rather inclined to put up with a great deal of annoyance (to no little of which they have been subjected at different times, such as the cutting up of their melon vines in the night, and similar kindly actions) rather than come into unfriendly collision with us Europeans.\nThey informed me that the attack upon them on the previous Saturday lasted a full hour, from 3 to 4 o'clock.\nIt only requires I know, that this state of affairs should be made public to ensure the complete safety of these men; for though many of our most honourable do not approve of inundating this land with Chinese, yet there are few worth call\u00eeng men who would refuse to protect those who have formed an asylum among us, and who are certainly &quot;The strangers that are within our gates.&quot;\nTo take the very lowest ground of all, and call them animals, then they must be protected, for we have a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\nI think it only fair to state, that these larrikins were not residents of the neighbourhood, but were en route from some unknown point of interest to another.</i> August 16.
