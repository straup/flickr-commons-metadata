The problems being is that they forgot to put it here!. I have copied two of the posts in order to further this discussion.\n\nPosted by: &quot;Ian&quot; ianadunn \nWed Mar 14, 2012 4:27 pm (PDT) \n\nIt has a Thow funnel and acetylene headlamp, so that narrows it to the period 1899-1921. And it is numbered 296, not 296X, so it must be before 1917.\n\nRe: K296 photo from State Records \nPosted by: &quot;David Bromage&quot; Wed Mar 14, 2012 8:58 pm (PDT) \nI think I may have narrowed this down even further. There had been a protracted dispute with PWD which only wanted to pay the men 9s 8d per day for four days per week. PWD spent much of January and February in Trades Hall. The dispute was eventually settled by, amongst other things, agreeing to assist the wives of many of the workers to move to Condobolin. The first sod was turned on Friday 19 March and, according to the Barrier Miner, the newly arrived wives planned to take advantage of an excursion train &quot;at the beginning of next week&quot;. This could be the picnic train in the photo.\nDavid", "authorname": "iain stuart", "id": "27286215-6965299563-72157629594820887", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6965299563/#comment72157629250007778", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1332111676", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/7892196@N02] Interesting stuff!
