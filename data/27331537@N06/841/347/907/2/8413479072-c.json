The old Fort Street Girls' High School, now part of the National Trust, is just south of the buildings that were marooned on the circular Cahill Expressway loop, although you could say it was also effectively marooned. \nThe photo is around 9 months after the Harbour Bridge opened. The curved &quot;unfinished&quot; area in the foreground is the roof of the tram tunnels headed from the Bridge to Wynyard under York Street. You can see their alignment in the aerial photo you supplied. The railway tunnels would be adjacent and under the roadway. \nPicture of the foreground area here in 1901, the Grand Hotel on the left sat on the south west corner of Essex St, and Essex Street ran straight through dead-centre to the Fort Street High School building. So, the Grand Hotel would have sat in the foreground of the top picture, and that's probably the hotel footings showing.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8189453150/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-8413479072-72157632894528362", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8413479072/#comment72157632900432980", "realname": "Andy Brill", "path_alias": "angeljim46", "author": "55198937@N05", "iconserver": "8463", "datecreate": "1362259465", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/63385174@N06]  Thanks grenadier for that additional information.", "authorname": "AndyBrii", "id": "27286215-8413479072-72157632900432980", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "8413479072"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618667}
