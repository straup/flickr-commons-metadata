Its name was changed to Necropolis prior to 1872 and changed again to Mortuary General Cemetery on 16th July 1897. It was then changed to Cemetery Station No 1 15th June 1908 when the Roman Catholic Platform, which had been opened on 31st December 1901, had its name changed to Cemetery Station No 2. Mortuary Station No 3, which opened on 26th May 1897, became known as Mortuary Terminus two months later. Its name was changed to Cemetery Station No. 3 in June 1908 to create uniformity between the station names within the cemetery.\n\nThe line's name was changed to the Rookwood branch line on 1st January 1914. No trace remains of it today except for the points and a short section of track that led to the cemetery line beyond Lidcombe station. The No. 1 Mortuary Station was constructed in 1864 and remained in use as the main station until the line's closure in December 1948. It was used as a chapel until 1958 when a fire gutted its interior. The Gothic-style building was then dismantled and re-erected stone by stone in Canberra as All Saints Anglican Church in the parish of Ainslie . The Redfern Mortuary Terminal, Regent Street, Redfern, from which trains left the city on their journey to Rookwood, was opened in 1869 and closed simultaneously with No 1 Mortuary Station at Rookwood Cemetery. St Paul's Anglican Church (which is today The Greek Orthodox Church), 242 Cleveland Street, Redfern, was the church where Anglican funeral services were held prior to the departure of funeral trains from the nearby Mortuary Station...&quot;", "authorname": "Sydney Heritage", "id": "27286215-7046616029-72157629392589482", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7046616029/#comment72157629784098447", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1334058609", "_content": "The siding into the cemetery is only &quot;beyond&quot; Lidcombe, if you are coming from Parramatta.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-7046616029-72157629784098447", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7046616029/#comment72157629796198537", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1334184797", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sydneyhistory] Thanks for the extra information.\n-AG", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-7046616029-72157629796198537", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7046616029"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619373}
