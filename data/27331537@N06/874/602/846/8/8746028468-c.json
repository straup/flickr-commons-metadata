At one time it was a prominent structure, and with its balconied front, and central archway leading into a regular English-looking coach-yard, it formed quite a feature in the landscape. It is now almost elbowed out of existence by the business places on each side. Eating houses, where a cheap meal is provided, oyster saloons and places where prawns and lobsters are vended, fruiterer's shops, and other similar places abound. Lifting itself above the roof line of the lower of these buildings still stands the tower - from which the old hostelry in front takes its name giving quite a feudal aspect to the scene.  \n\nIt has occupied that site for almost fifty years [built c.1840], and is quite an old Sydney landmark. It is built of squared stones with battlemented walls, and from the lofty embrasures some wooden cannon, or ' Quakers,' are projected. At each corner of the battlements looks out the half-length carved effigy of a king or knight, with sword in hand or battle-axe on shoulder, while a large weathercock and vane surmounting the low Norman roof indicates 'how the wind blows'. \n\nIt was built by a man named Hancock, and was familiarly called 'Hancock's Tower'.  Years ago many romantic legends used to cluster about this building, like the swallows that circled around it. Of these stories ever 'on the wing' was one to the effect that the builder put it up as a prison for his wife, and many a time in our child-life while passing by the place we used to fancy we could see the unfortunate lady peeping through the upper windows. But the fact is that Hancock was a shrewd, hard-working wheelwright, who had his 'smithy ' at the intersection of George-street and Market-street, just about where the palatial hotel of Charles J. Roberts now stands. Having made considerable money at his trade, Hancock settled himself down on the then somewhat rural site now under discussion, and with the national prejudice that 'an Englishman's house is  \nhis castle'. he gave his residence as warlike an aspect as possible. \n\nIn the courtyard between the Tower and the Inn in front, he had a large stone statue erected,  and various flower-beds and trellised arbours formed, so that altogether it was a pleasant glimpse of the Tower Inn yard some years ago.  But the utilitarian spirit has waved its wand over the spot,  and it now wears somewhat the look of 'Tom all-alone's'.  &quot;</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-8746028468-72157634250192538", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8746028468/#comment72157634261658484", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1371887264", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeasdaddy] You were right!
