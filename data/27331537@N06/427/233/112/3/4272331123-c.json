The position of drinking fountains in the Gardens were marked on Maiden's 1903 map as small squares with a dot in them. J. H. Maiden, in his evidence the the Royal Commission on the improvements of Sydney, 1909, said: 'Every street in Sydney should have its drinking-fountain. It should be at least as easy to obtain a drink of pure water as a glass of milk or beer. Sydney is a sub-tropical city, and sometimes it is warm and sometimes it is dusty ... Sydney should be a city of fountains.' [source: David Churches, The Cultural Significance of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, 1990, p. 791.]\n\nIn Maiden's time there were many drinking fountains in the Gardens:\n\n(a) Palm Grove\nSource: -\nDate/Place: Located at entrance to Palm Grove, marked as K on Maiden's map of 1903\nRemoved: c. 1917\nAdditional Information: The ornate marble drinking fountain in the Palm Grove (site identified by old photographs) was surmounted by small marble(?) statue of girl (angel?) on a stand supported by four columns. Maiden complained that: 'certain mischievous boys and other people delight in wrenching off the cups, damaging the spouts and injuring the fountains in various ways'. By 1914: 'The old taps and enamel mugs, which had been in use for drinking purposes fro varying periods ... [were replaced with] ... bubbling fountains ... which have been in use in the Botanical Gardens and Outer Domain for some years. They are more sanitary, and are appreciated by the public.' [source: BG/AR, 1915, p. 40.] The existing sandstone bubblers in the Gardens probably come from this era. The new bubblers, on the path from the Tropical Centre to the Palm Grove and at the top of the Palace Garden Steps, were made in the same style.\n_____\n\nThere is an associated photo with the entry of the fountain dated 1887, from the RBG Library.", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-4272331123-72157623439236384", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4272331123/#comment72157623326088985", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1266371901", "_content": "Here is a similar photograph by Henry King from the Powerhouse Museum's Tyrrell collection:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/imageservices/index.php/2010/02/the-fountain-botanical-gardens-sydney/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/imageservices/index.php/2010/02/...</a>\n\nAnd here in the zoomable collection database:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30967\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30967</a>\n\nZooming in makes it clear that the base, columns and cupola of the drinking fountain are of marble, although the bottommost plinth appears to not  be of marble.\n\nThe woman in the Henry King photograph is holding a mug which she is filling with liquid from a fountain spout.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "27286215-4272331123-72157623326088985", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4272331123/#comment72157623326519095", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1266377155", "_content": "Thanks for the Henry King links.
