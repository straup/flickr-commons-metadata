Lease the Port of Newcastle and apply the proceeds to the rejuvenation of the city. This includes replacing the current heavy rail with light rail. One would think that this would be a reasonable trade-off (but I don't know current passenger numbers).  The Hunter Street Line (am I the first to use the term?) could be a great start to a new Newcastle light rail system, augmenting buses on longer routes. It will be interesting to see how this one develops. \n\nBut please, powers that be, retain and preserve Newcastle Railway Station.
