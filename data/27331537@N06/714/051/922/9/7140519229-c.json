In the 1930s still cameras didn't shoot 6 frames per second, so it took some skill to snap something like this. Perfect timing, fast shutter speed, widish aperture but with enough depth of field to get the principal big wigs in focus, and all this in not ideal lighting conditions (ie. strong sunlight). I gather that the then Governor-General Sir Isaac Isaacs is the bloke in the top hat beside NSW Governor Sir Philip Game (the bloke with the feather duster thing on his head)...here's a Sam Hood pic of Isaacs in his snazzy G-G's outfit, with Lady Isaacs- <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=42811\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=42811</a> ; here's Isaacs' ADB entry - <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/isaacs-sir-isaac-alfred-6805\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/isaacs-sir-isaac-alfred-6805</a> ; \nTalk about blokes world! Maybe there's a couple of women out of focus in the background...it's difficult to tell. Maybe all the women were at home dutifully baking scones whilst helping the children make matchstick models of the Harbour Bridge in the bathtub. Later that afternoon somewhere nearby: &quot;Jeez I've had a hard day Doreen. Had ter attend another blinkin' bridge opening!&quot;...&quot;Oh how truly tewwible for you darling! Just sit there and relax and I'll bring you a nice cup of tea and one of my freshly baked scones&quot;...&quot;Jeez on ya Doreen!&quot;", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "27286215-7140519229-72157630026395384", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7140519229/#comment72157630071226892", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1339052057", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Indeed it is! \nI'll add the GG's and the NSW Governors names into the title.\n-AG", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-7140519229-72157630071226892", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7140519229/#comment72157630031060405", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1339320418", "_content": "There seem to have been several ribbon-cuttings.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-7140519229-72157630031060405", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7140519229/#comment72157630040697265", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1339419398", "_content": "Indeed! - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44252\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44252</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44242\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44242</a> ; de Groot and NSW Premier Jack Lang evidently cut the ribbon at the southern end, North Sydney Mayor Alderman Primrose did the  honours at the northern end....here's the SMH report which mentions the ceremony at the northern end - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16849532\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16849532</a> ; I've just realised that the bloke on the viewer's rhs (behind Game) is the then Australian PM Joe Lyons, who per some newspaper reports appears to have been snubbed at the Harbour Bridge opening...if so, then this might have been due to the fact that Lyons was a controversial figure at the time...the NSW Laborites would have regarded him as a 'Labor rat'...here Lyons is speaking to engineer Lawrence Ennis, who was director of construction for the Harbour Bridge contractor Dorman Long &amp; Co - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=9974\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=9974</a> ; here's a pic of Lyons with J.C.
