Originally flanking the front entrance to the William Street Wing of the Australian Museum the fluted columns were dismantled and moved to Centennial Park where they were then used as the base for these statues. \n\nCoincidentally, the Australian Museum was designed by James Barnet who also designed the Superintendent\u2019s Residence in Centennial Park, which was constructed between 1866 and 1868.&quot;\n\n\n( ref. <a href=\"http://www.centennialparklands.com.au/resources/history_and_heritage/statues_memorials_sculptures_and_gates/sandstone_columns)\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.centennialparklands.com.au/resources/history_and_heri...</a>\n\n\nAccording to the Park's website historical timeline 2 columns from the Asutralian Museum were installed in 1890. \n\n(ref. <a href=\"http://www.centennialparklands.com.au/resources/history_and_heritage/historical_timeline)\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.centennialparklands.com.au/resources/history_and_heri...</a>\n\nHere's a view of Centennial Park in 1895 showing 2 distant  tall columns topped by statues:\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn4469751-s32\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn4469751-s32</a>\n\nThe Park's website states that the two sandstone columns are today  topped as follows:\n\n&quot;Today, sadly only three statues remain: two terracotta statues, \u2018Sunrise\u2019 and \u2018Sunset\u2019, on sandstone columns in the Rose Garden (the third being the \u2018We Won\u2019 statue in Cannon Triangle).\n\nWhile many of the terracotta figures and statues were removed in 1971 due to damage, two of the most striking statues remained: \u2018Sunrise\u2019 and \u2018Sunset\u2019 (it was considered that their lofty position gave them adequate protection).\n\nThese two statues which sit atop the magnificent sandstone columns in the Rose and Column Gardens are the only statues to have continuously remained on site. As such, they are a significant landmark within the Park. Manufactured by the famous Luxembourg pottery company, Villeroy and Boch in 1888, \u2018Sunrise\u2019 is a standing female figure with a baby boy on a half orb, while \u2018Sunset\u2019 is a life size female figure draped in a cloak from the back of the head to the feet. &quot;", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "27286215-4255176790-72157623165112144", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4255176790/#comment72157623165573820", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1262951244", "_content": "Good work Bob!
