I thought &quot;parklet&quot; was a modern Californian term, but I see now it was current in 1931 - SMH 21/8/1931 page 10 -  <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16827482\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16827482</a> .\n\nI came across Bradfield's own description of his Bridge for a SMH Supplement on 19/3/1932 which is interesting reading.
