The Central District was originally in charge of the Central Sydney (CBD) area, but gradually expanded to include all the Sydney Metropolitan Districts. The photo appears to be taken near Central Railway Station, where the ambulance headquarters were located. The lane is called Ambulance Avenue and is still there, just off Broadway. The NSWATSB was made up of members from the various District committees throughout NSW and was partly funded by the NSW Government. It was the fore runner to today's Ambulance Service of NSW.", "authorname": "sv1ambo", "id": "27286215-3293684763-72157625640729471", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3293684763/#comment72157625662711675", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1294625397", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/50415738@N04] Thanks for this extra interesting info.

It is just of Railway Square and in the driveway that takes you under the station itself, which used to be called Ambulance Avenue.
