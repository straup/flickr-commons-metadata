This gentleman was Mr. Daniel Cooper, the proprietor of the Waterloo warehouse. Portions of the old building still form part of the &quot;Evening News&quot; offices.\n\nThe warehouse, then known as the Lachlan and Waterloo Stores, the proprietors of which were Messrs. Cooper and Levy, was situated at first on the corner of King and George streets, but in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; of May 6, 1821, it was announced that the warehouse had been removed to George and Market streets. This latter site comprised the greater part of an allotment leased by Governor Macquarie to James Smith, on January 2, 1819, for 14 years. It was sold by auction on February 13, 1821, and purchased by Daniel Cooper.\n\nCooper and Levy called for tenders at the end of that year for the stone and brick work of a new warehouse. Mr. Levy afterwards dropped out as a partner, and was replaced by Mr. Holt. The firm did a large country business, supplemented by banking and money-lending. They issued what were known as Waterloo notes, one of the few paper currencies which were always worth their face value.\n\nSir Daniel Cooper, a nephew of the original Cooper, was afterwards a partner in the firm. When Anthony Trollope visited Australia, in 1871, he dined at Woollahra House one night with Sir Daniel Cooper, and said of Woollahra:\n\n&quot;It is a magnificent property, covered with villas and gardens, all looking down upon a glorious sea. In England it would be worth half a million of money, and as things go on it will soon be worth as much in New South Wales. And perhaps some future Cooper will be Duke Cooper or Marquis Cooper, and Woollahra will be as famous as Lowther or Chatsworth. It is infinitely more lovely than either. I envied the young man, and almost hated him for having it\u2014although he had just given me an excellent dinner&quot;\n\n(THE STORY OF OLD GEORGE STREET. BY CHARLES H.
