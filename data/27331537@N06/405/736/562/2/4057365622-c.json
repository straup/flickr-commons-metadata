The Town Hall was occupied in September 1874 and gradually extended to include the clock tower in 1881, the Main Hall in 1889 and its grand organ in 1890. \n\nA public holiday was proclaimed when Sydney Town Hall opened on 27 November 1889. In the 1897 a porte-coch\u00e8re, not a part of the original Town Hall design, replaced the wide steps approaching the Town Hall entrance, but when excavations for the underground Town Hall railway station severely weakened it in 1934, the porte-coch\u00e8re  was declared unstable and demolished. In the opinion of architects, this addition did not improve the appearance of the building, and many were gratified at its removal and the reinstatement of the original broad staircase.", "authorname": "juantoo34", "id": "27286215-4057365622-72157638297576216", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4057365622"}, "flarchive:created": 1389621451}
