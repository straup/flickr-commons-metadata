Allocated road number No 465 of the P(6) class, it commenced service in mid 1892 on the NSWGR. The class arose from the urgent need to design modern motive power to deal with the increasing weight of passenger and mail trains. Though Thow had designed a 4-6-0 when CME of the South Australian Railways, the P(6) class was revolutionary in sheer size and output. Predating the first 4-6-0 in the United Kingdom by 18 months, the class took over all important services immediately with very few problems, remarkable in such innovative engines. They were used to introduce premier passenger expresses, including the south Coast Daylight, the Caves Express, the Newcastle Express and 'The Fish'. Such was the success of the first 50 locomotives delivered, that further orders were placed with Beyer Peacock and other builders leading to a total of 191 being delivered between 1892 and 1911. The design was also used as the basis for the \u2018G\u2019 class, first passenger locomotives built for the Commonwealth Railways, working the line between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. \n\nUnchallenged on mainline passenger service until the advent of the C35 and C36 classes, the C32 as they became after the 1924 re-numbering, maintained a significant presence on secondary mainline and branch workings until the late 1960s. Withdrawn from service in January 1970, 3214 was transferred to the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, arriving at Thirlmere in 1975. It along with sister 3203 was maintained for tour working for some years afterwards, finally being set aside for static display at the Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum...\n\nValley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museu Locomotive 3214\n<a href=\"http://infobluemountains.net.au/locodepot/exhibits_3214.shtml\" title=\"Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://infobluemountains.net.au/locodepot/images/exhibit_3214a.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"232\" alt=\"Locomotive 3214\" /></a>", "authorname": "myhappypenguin", "id": "27286215-5016929730-72157630205613024", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5016929730/#comment72157630214743670", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1340236349", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hpeters] Thanks for the extra detail!\n- AG", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-5016929730-72157630214743670", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5016929730/#comment72157631792391167", "realname": "Rue89", "path_alias": "rue89", "author": "36463759@N08", "iconserver": "4139", "datecreate": "1350493666", "_content": "Hi,\nWe're a French news website called Rue89 (<a href=\"http://www.rue89.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.rue89.com</a>) and are about to use this picture (with link and credit) to illustrate a story on our site, observing the Creative Commons conditions mentioned in this page.\n\nIf you do not want us to reproduce your work on our site, just email us webmaster[at]rue89.com.\n\nCongratulations for this photo.", "authorname": "Rue89", "id": "27286215-5016929730-72157631792391167", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5016929730/#comment72157631795534510", "realname": "Photographic Collection", "path_alias": "state-records-nsw", "author": "27331537@N06", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1350525198", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/rue89] Thanks for letting us know, I'm sure we'd all love to see the article when it's published!\n\nAB", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-5016929730-72157631795534510", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5016929730/#comment72157632774522919", "realname": "grahamH", "path_alias": "grahamh_pix", "author": "11299198@N07", "iconserver": "2112", "datecreate": "1360999296", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.rue89.com/2012/10/17/revolution-limprimante-3d-la-machine-vapeur-du-xxie-siecle-236194\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.rue89.com/2012/10/17/revolution-limprimante-3d-la-mac...</a>\n\nFrom a file, the 3D printer allows (almost) anyone to create an object.
