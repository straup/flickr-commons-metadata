Well done.\n\nWhat a picturesque corner it used to be.  Am I right in thinking that the tree (Moreton Bay fig?) is still there at the end of Watson Street?.  The houses are propping up the Sydney Harbour Bridge southern approach.\n\nIt has often struck me when looking at the c.1900 photos of The Rocks and Sydney, just how little vegetation there used to be.  Contemporary comparison photos and Google street view are often like a jungle in comparison.  In this photo the streetscape is improved considerably by that tree.  Wonderful shade from the westerly sun, as the Casneaux photo well shows.\n\n10 June 1927 was a Friday.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-5082075259-72157625046613887", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5082075259/#comment72157625245030574", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1288089986", "_content": "The terrace was called 'Clontarf Terrace' - see [http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2555445558/]\n\nor <a href=\"http://from.ph/29723\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.ph/29723</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-5082075259-72157625245030574", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5082075259"}, "flarchive:created": 1389620621}
