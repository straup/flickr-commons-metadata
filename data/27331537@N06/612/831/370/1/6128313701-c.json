For a few months the Street View has had little square thumbnails with an exact photo match, which must be automatically found by the search engine using image recognition technology, from Panoramio or Picasa,  not posted by punters).  As you hover your mouse on them, the photo appears in the same plane (how?!), and you can click through to the photo in Picasa.\n\nI remember SRNSW were interested in getting photos geotagged and marked on maps;  it seems  the Great God of Google may be savvy enough to do it automatically.  Unfortunately Google does not (yet) own Flickr / Yahoo / Microsoft,  and you might have to post images to Picasa. \n\nHere is an example for St Mary's Cathedral - hover over the thumbnail to the right of the porch - <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=-33.87136,151.212891&amp;spn=0.000018,0.010568&amp;t=h&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-33.87126,151.212907&amp;panoid=PRZaGDHsTWKd75OUhUOYWA&amp;cbp=12,60.71,,0,-1.28&amp;z=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=-33.87136,151.212891&am...</a>\n(btw the geo co-ordinates are embedded in the URL code)\n\nThere is also a site which specializes then and now historical views,  which I have not fully investigated yet.
