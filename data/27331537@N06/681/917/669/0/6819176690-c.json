It may be the long shadows and afternoon light [as my recollection of that part of the park is that west is photo right] but I think that 3 of the cars may have WW2 blackout white lines painted on their mudguards. The mudguards of the tourer, photo centre with child on running board, are maybe lined in white paint as are the mudguard and running board of the late 30s car nearest the bridge and possibly the tourer on the extreme right of the photo? As I say it could be the afternoon light or, as lighter coloured mudguards were used on some vintage cars, it just may be a fashionable paint job! If it\u2019s blackout markings then the photo would be early 1942 or after as I think the blackout measures were not required in Sydney till after December 1941.\n\nI feel that the fashions and hairstyles are early 1940s?\n\nIs there enough info for our shadows dating expert? The new Fullers Bridge over the river is pretty much on the same alignment as the old bridge [built 1918] in the photo.\n\nState Library NSW has similar images in a series dated 1943 under Lane Cove National Park \u2013 same era cars and same style of dress.\nACTUALLY just found the same photo with less cropping \u2013 dated 10/1943 Digital order no. d1_22620 <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=191531\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=191531</a>", "authorname": "jennys old cars", "id": "27286215-6819176690-72157629581798435", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6819176690/#comment72157629251804580", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "14440458@N06", "iconserver": "2003", "datecreate": "1332128744", "_content": "good detective work there.
