In May of the same year, Commadander Charles L. Lewin, RN, was appointed as the first Carrnander of the \u2018Training School. On 18th Novextber 1911 Navy Order No 81 promulgated information that SOBRAON would be renamed TINGIRA.\n\n\nBoys On Deck - Knot Tying Instruction and Practice\n\nTINGIRA comtmissioned in the Royal Australian Navy on 25th April 1912 and on 1st June the first batch of 37 boys recruited by New South Wales joined for training. These were followed by drafts from other States to complete the first intake of 100 boys. Entry was limited to boys between the ages of 14 and a half and 16 years. Recruits were bound to serve for seven years following their eighteenth birthday. Minimum height standards varied from 4 feet 10 inches at 14 and a half, to 5 feet 2 inches at 16 years, with chest measurenent 29 inches to 32 inches.\n\nThe last draft of TINGIRA boys began their training in 1926 and in August that year recruiting of boys ceased. On 30th June 1921 TINGIRA paid off for disposal. In the fifteen years and one month of her RAN commission 2,941 boys were trained in her to take their place as sailors in the Fleet. Tingira remained moored at Garden Island or Rose Bay for her entire naval career.", "authorname": "Highranger", "id": "27286215-3682708645-72157630277616898", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3682708645/#comment72157631028431220", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1344759831", "_content": "Here's an 1893 Sydney Mail article on the Sobraon...sketches appear on pp. 28-29 - <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DhdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TpUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7116,110366\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=DhdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TpUDA...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "27286215-3682708645-72157631028431220", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3682708645/#comment72157631798248829", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1350567228", "_content": "Just posted by the ANMM - \n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8099067140/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-3682708645-72157631798248829", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3682708645"}, "flarchive:created": 1389680626}
