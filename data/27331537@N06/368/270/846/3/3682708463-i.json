Boys received a combination of moral training, nautical and industrial training and instruction, and elementary schooling. The ships were made use of this way as there were no separate boys' reformatory schools until 1895. \n\nThe <em>Vernon</em> was docked at Cockatoo Island. The <em>Sobraon</em>, which replaced the <em>Vernon</em> in 1892, was used until 1911, when the remaining boys were set to the Mittagong Farm Home for Boys and the Brush Farm Home for Boys. \n\nThe Industrial Schools Act of 1866 authorised the Governor to proclaim &quot;any ship or vessel or any building or place together with any yards, enclosures grounds or lands attached thereto to be a 'Public Industrial School' &quot;. Any vagrant or destitute child under the age of sixteen could be directed by two Justices of the Peace to attend an Industrial School and to remain the responsibility of the Superintendent until the age of eighteen, unless apprenticed out or discharged.  \n\nMore information can be found in <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Advanced.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Archives Investigator</a> -&gt; Advanced Search -&gt; Agency -&gt; 411\n\nThis series of photographs was taken by officers of the Government Printing Office during the years 1860s-c.1920.
