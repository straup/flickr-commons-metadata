It accepted patients from Victoria up until 1848 when the Yarra Bend asylum was opened. By the mid 1960s the institution was known simply as Gladesville Hospital. In 1993 premises at Gladesville Hospital and Macquarie Hospital were revoked as hospitals, and were amalgamated to form the Gladesville Macquarie Hospital.\n\nThis series of photographs was taken by officers of the Government Printing Office during the years 1860s-c.1920. The photographs cover a wide variety of subjects, for example, public buildings, railways, tramways, street scenes, harbour views, Sydney University, groups of people, ships, public occasions, the Botanic Gardens, military camps, wharves, dams and waterways, statues and slums.\n\nMany other photos in our collection are available to view and browse on our website using <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photosearch.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Photo Investigator</a>."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2629", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-01-22 15:47:38", "lastupdate": "1369940996", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1246588939"}, "originalsecret": "9dd7ba4b4f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3543", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3683566980/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389680610}
