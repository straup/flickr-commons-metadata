They were first held on <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14250341\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monday 25 December 1899</a>, with the last reported weekly Monday race being held on <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14553369\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monday 25 May 1903</a>. The trotting track was bought by <a href=\"http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110670b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir James John Joynton Smith</a> in 1903 and renovated and renamed Epping. Newspapermen were given a <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14663934\" rel=\"nofollow\">tour of the new racecourse</a> when renovations were complete in June 1904.

I imagine those intending to catch a tram to the races would wait by the hut, as this would correspond to the tram routes mentioned (in the previous link): &quot;Trams (Forest Lodge and Balmain) will leave Circular Quay, via George Street&quot;.\n\nSo, taking all this into consideration with Walter Liberty Vernon's Customs House rebuild completed in 1903, I think we can safely say: 1903 it is!\n\n[With thanks to the wonderful digitised newspaper resources of <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper?q=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trove</a>]", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "27286215-5215291939-72157625366767177", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5215291939/#comment72157625492315236", "realname": "Nicole Davis", "path_alias": "agrippinamaior", "author": "20958381@N08", "iconserver": "2087", "datecreate": "1291038199", "_content": "Wow!
