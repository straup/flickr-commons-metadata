George Street trams halted only \u201cwhen required\u201d at the Fire Station, Essex Street, Bridge Street, Hunter Street, Bathurst Street, Liverpool Street, Goulburn Street, Hay Street, Gipps Street (now Barlow Street), and the top of Pitt Street.

I don't know how much extra it would cost to have the work done after the day's traffic has subsided, but it couldn't possibly equal the cost of the traffic congestion caused by doing the job in the daytime. And, with trams inching their way across the rails, the men on the job can only work in snatches.
