The street we see on the right is Slip Street. Behind the photographer the tram lines turn into Erskine Street before entering a balloon loop using New and Shelley Streets. The tram lines are the city end of the Watson's Bay line which was converted from Cable operation to electric traction between 1902 and 1905. My guess would be that the photo was perhaps taken soon after the opening of the electric line along Day Street - before the conversion the cable tram terminated in King Street.", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-9417082221-72157634899161884", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9417082221/#comment72157634958762529", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1375833667", "_content": "It looks too hilly to be Hickson Road", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-9417082221-72157634958762529", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9417082221/#comment72157634958817901", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1375834002", "_content": "The SMH on 25 October 1902 reports Mr Walter Saxton leaving the business he worked for, to start his own contracting business.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-9417082221-72157634958817901", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9417082221/#comment72157634958888449", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1375834512", "_content": "behind that iron truss,   you can see the Pyrmont bridge crossing over Day St a block further down,  including the big fat toadstool pillars which still exist.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-9417082221-72157634958888449", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9417082221/#comment72157634965297852", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1375834886", "_content": "Plan J of the 1900 resumption plan covers this neighbourhood,   and in 1900,  it looked very different.
