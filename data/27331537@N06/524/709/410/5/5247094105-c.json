To its left and right are visible the rear sections of 2 late 1930s sedans.\nCar coming towards photographer is a 1935 Ford Fordor sedan, judging by the distinctive radiator grill chrome strips. This car and the other sedans parked at the kerb have the older style island  fabric roof (ie. pre all steel body) and date 1928-1935/6.\nThe soft top tourers and roadsters shown date from the late 1920s to early 1930s (1933-34).
