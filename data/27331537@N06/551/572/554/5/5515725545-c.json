Cities were on a much more human scale when buildings were limited to three or four stories, and steeples and towers were wonderful visions and markers on the horizon.  But the lack of services and sanitation, the pollution and smog from all those coal fires, and the smell of horse poo and wee in the streets would have been dreadful!
