The two buildings in the background were demolished in the early years of the twentieth century (1922 [?] needs to be confirmed) thus extending the 'plaza' which now forms that end of the quay. During the renovations the whole area along that (the western) side of Circular Quay was opened up, the tramways rerouted and the current &quot;configuration&quot; of streets created, spoilt, many would say (a former PM included) by the addition of the Circular Quay railway and Cahill Expressway in the 1950s.\n\nThe building on he corner of Barton and George Streets is a fire station - I love the tower - but I'm not sure what the other building housed.
