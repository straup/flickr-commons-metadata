One such was John Slater, \u2018Mechanical Inventor\u2019 of Howlong. Slater was clearly an enthusiastic amateur inventor, and keen to make it clear that he was also both a true Englishman and a good colonist. The government was sufficiently interested to reply, taking him up on his offer to supply further details. However, on receipt of the model and associated lengthy notes, the authorities decided not to take the matter further, after receiving advice from naval officers that the proposal was not practical.\n\nNRS 906 Colonial Secretary: Main series of letters received, 1826-1982\nEnclosure to Letter (model) from John Slater 21 March 1888 re his anti-torpedo inventions 88/3779, in [1/2718B]\n<a href=\"http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/50-years-at-state-records-nsw/4-07/\" rel=\"nofollow\">View on the Gallery &raquo; </a>\n\nRights: <a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/about-us/rights-and-permissions\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.records.nsw.gov.au/about-us/rights-and-permissions</a>\n\nWe'd love to <a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">hear from you</a> if you use our photos/documents."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1761", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-21 12:26:54", "lastupdate": "1386954237", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1299796018"}, "originalsecret": "9134aa1d2b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5098", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5515496109/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620206}
