The rubble to the left of the shot would appear to indicate construction work on the future station is well underway.  The tram is an N-class vehicle the first of which No 295 entered service in June 1901. This means that the shot was taken at least six years after the date attributed to it above and possibly closer to the date the new station came into use in 1906  (judging from the rubble). The tram is in it's original livery, and features open drivers' cabins, and looks brand new so it could be on its &quot;maiden run&quot;? So I'd date it circa 1905 in lieu of 1895.\n\nHere's the site today:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johncowper/5612999818]", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-9318314986-72157634705635172", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/9318314986/#comment72157634699486513", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1374233156", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/johncowper] Aha, that explains it, thank you!
