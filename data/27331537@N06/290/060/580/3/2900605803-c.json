The larger building on the left is on the north side of the line. This was the main station building, and only a few hundred meters from Eskbank House, and there was, and still is, a smaller shelter to the south of the line and it is shown on the right of the image. This means the image is taken looking towards Sydney, and the location of the &quot;new&quot; Lithgow station is behind the camera. The layout of the buildings is such that the image has not been reversed duing printing.\n\nThe bridge in the image no longer exists, but there is one about 50 meters behind the camera position, between this station and the new Lithgow Station.\n\nI may try to get in location to do some modern images of some of the old Lithgow images to allow people to do a comparison of the old and new. I have a collection of a few hundred local images and have considered doing this as a bit of a project next year.", "authorname": "LithgowLights", "id": "27286215-2900605803-72157637727283023", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2900605803"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681052}
