He was a much wanted child as they had lost a baby daughter and Elizabeth had suffered a number of miscarriages. Their son's illness caused them enough concern for a trip to Newcastle to be postponed. While our research has been inconclusive 'Worm Fever' is thought likely to be two separate, but concurrent infections: intestinal worms which would create a lot of itching; plus a viral infection (like flu) that caused a high temperature, flushed skin, headache etc.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/digital-gallery/lachlan-macquarie-visionary-and-builder/lachlan-macquarie-visionary-and-builder\" rel=\"nofollow\">&raquo; Lachlan Macquarie Gallery</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/digital-gallery/lachlan-macquarie-visionary-and-builder/general/NRS937-4-3498 p280.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">&raquo; Full transcript of this letter</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1474", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-12-08 14:24:42", "lastupdate": "1369941013", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1269914185"}, "originalsecret": "ab134cdf8f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2752", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4475274796/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621176}
