I haven't seen a pic of this vehicle before.  It is obviously Sydney, Australia, and the tram is a &quot;P&quot; type of that system.  It would be nice if someone could identify the location.  It is a major junction, judging by all the tramway poles (with the little caps) and all the wire !  I'll have a guess and suggest corner of Alison Road and Darley Road, Randwick, at the entrance to the tramway workshops.", "authorname": "1kevin2", "id": "27286215-5864512631-72157633850886421", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5864512631"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619921}
