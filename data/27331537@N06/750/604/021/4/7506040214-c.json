In the following year, Harry P. Gill, the Gallery\u2019s Honorary Curator, travelled to Britain to buy works for Adelaide. Gill spent a large proportion of the Elder bequest on eighty-nine works of art, including thirty-four oil paintings, most of them purchased from or through Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons. In one stroke, Gill had acquired works by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Aubrey Beardsley, \u00c9mile Claus, William Fettes Douglas, Henri Fantin-Latour, Benjamin Leader, Frederic Leighton, Edward Poynter, Frederick Cayley Robinson, Giovanni Segantini, George Watts and William Bouguereau. Even though these were contemporary, or nearly contemporary works mostly by living artists, they were nevertheless the single most important group of acquisitions in the Gallery\u2019s history since they brought to the collection a model of consistently high quality and comprehensiveness that in future would guide its collecting in other areas.&quot; - <a href=\"http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Collection/european_and_north_american_paintings_and_sculpture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Collection/european_an...</a>\n\n<b>The Art Gallery.
