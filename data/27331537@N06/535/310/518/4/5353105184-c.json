It was also prepared by the Sydney Railway Company, six years before Government took the company over.\n\nThere's no doubt Darling Harbour was in their thoughts, early plans had the line of road running closer to the harbour. The compromise was the Darling Harbour 'branch', which ran from Sydney station to the harbourside. \n\nOne later proposal for 'central' station was to bring the line all the way into the city terminating at St James in Hyde Park. Another saw the terminal at Circular Quay.\n\nDon Haggarty in his book &quot;Sydney Railway - 1848 - 1857&quot; (published 2005) has some interesting points to make on the subject of both the Darling Harbour branch and the various proposals for the location of the terminal station \n\nFor example, as late as 15 March 1853 James Wallace - the railway's engineer still proposed the line be extended to Hay Street - but it was on 3 December that year that the Colonial Secretary wrote to the President of the Sydney Railway Company - Charles Cowper - that approved building the terminal in Cleveland Paddocks - ie south of the current station. As I said above it was fifty-five years before the station was to move to its current location, and still short of the Hay Street proposal.

The meetings to devise the rules and organise the event were held in the officers' mess and many of the horses were owned by the officers. \n\nThe race meeting consisted of a series of heats with weights set depending on the sex and age of a horse. There were also a number of match races between two horses and sweepstake prizes offered. Governor Macquarie himself attended each day of the meeting. This format for race meetings was followed in the colony for the next 50 years. Owners mostly rode their own horses and the courses were marked by flags and posts. Novelty events were often included.\n\nMeetings continued to be held at Hyde Park up until the formation of the Sydney Turf Club in 1825 when they were moved to the 'Bellevue' course. Meetings were also run at Parramatta and Camperdown.
