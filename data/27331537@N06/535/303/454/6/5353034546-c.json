The wharves are at Walsh Bay -  the old ones before they were rebuilt.    The end of Miller's Point is at the left edge the photo.\n\nThe houses in the foreground are still there,   and you can match the irregular pattern of chimneys and attic windows on Google Earth.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-5353034546-72157627637177188", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5353034546/#comment72157627657375926", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "48420463@N05", "iconserver": "4139", "datecreate": "1315869663", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/mich2009] Thanks for that.
