Although to be fair to Mr Laws, aesthetics were not high on his or the nation\u2019s agenda in 1944. \n\nThe NSW Department of Main Roads was heavily involved in the war effort.

He wanted to return to Darwin on 21 February 1942 but because of the bombing by the Japanese he ended up travelling from Larramar [Larrimah] to Alice Springs with a number of evacuees from Darwin. He comments on the lack of information available to him and the uncomfortable journey to Alice Springs during which everything of value was either broken or stolen\n<a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/war-and-australia/images-1/northern-territory-evacuation-march-1942/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/research-topics/war...</a> \n\nJenny", "authorname": "State Records NSW", "id": "27286215-7306455010-72157630062281996", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7306455010/#comment72157634039062795", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79583367@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1370845920", "_content": "This photo clearly shows the overhead wiring arrangement for the trams, which had &quot;trolley poles&quot;, as distinct from that on the other side of the bridge, which was for trains, which had pantographs.", "authorname": "1kevin2", "id": "27286215-7306455010-72157634039062795", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7306455010"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619249}
