During Macquarie's administration there were many public works projects and improvements. This is a part of Macqaurie's own list of public works undertaken, 1810-1821, which includes public roads; Bathurst; Campbelltown; Castlereagh; Castle Hill; Cawdor; Emu Plains; George Town; Hobart; Launceston; Liverpool; Longbottom; Newcastle; Parramatta; Pennant Hills; Penrith; Pitt Town; Port Macquarie; Richmond; Rooty Hill; Springwood; Sydney; Vale of Clywdd, and; Wilberforce.\n\nThe significance of this list is that it is Macquarie's own account of the buildings and public works achieved under his Governorship of New South Wales. It is part of a much longer account of his achievements in New South Wales.\n\nWritten in London in July 1822 as Major General Macquarie, he is no longer Governor of NSW and is writing to Earl Bathurst giving an account of his administration in the hope of defending himself and his Governorship of NSW against the Bigge Report.\n\nThe list is from Historical Records of Australia Series I Volume 10 pages 684-701.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/digital-gallery/lachlan-macquarie-visionary-and-builder/lachlan-macquarie-visionary-and-builder\" rel=\"nofollow\">&raquo; Lachlan Macquarie Gallery</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1752", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-07-02 10:01:42", "lastupdate": "1369941018", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1278028902"}, "originalsecret": "1f4f834c03", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4143", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4752977187/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620990}
