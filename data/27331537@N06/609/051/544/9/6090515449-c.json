I especially liked the idea that the buildings allowed access at two levels, obviously for handling cargo quicker and more easily. The bridge you can see in the right background (I've noted it) facilitated this. There were a number of such bridges along Hickson Road. Again by cooincidence I went to school with a younger McEacharn - a descendant of the Malcolm McEacharn who started the shipping line.", "authorname": "john cowper", "id": "27286215-6090515449-72157627444503883", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/6090515449/#comment72157627447704451", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1314913090", "_content": "Also known as The Hungry Mile - \n<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/it-will-always-be-the-hungry-mile-and-now-thatx2019s-official-20090730-e33f.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.smh.com.au/national/it-will-always-be-the-hungry-mile...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.mua.org.au/media/uploads/TheHungryMilebook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mua.org.au/media/uploads/TheHungryMilebook.pdf</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "27286215-6090515449-72157627447704451", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6090515449"}, "flarchive:created": 1389619780}
