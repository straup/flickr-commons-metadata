SENTENCE OF DEATH PASSED.\n\nAt the Central Criminal Court Charles Herbert Splatt, aged 25, was place on trial on a charge of having murdered his wife, Selina Spratt at North Sydney on November 17 last The case for the Crown was to the effect that although they had been married since Match 17 1914, the accused and his wife had never lived together. He was a turner and fitter. His wife, who was formerly a Miss Cork, was employed at the Sydney Ferry Company's change box at Circular Quay. They met each other at the Quay\n\nOn the night of the tragedy he went to the house and shot his wife, afterwards turning the revolver on himself. On the day of the tragedy the wife had gone to a tramway picnic down the harbour despite a request from her husband that they should spend the day together. \n\nIn his statement from the dock the accused declared that he loved his vvife dearly He did not know how he had come to shoot her \n\nThe evidence for the defence showed that the accused had been greatly worried from the time of his marriage because the wedding had been kept strictly. There were frequent quarrels chiefly over the fact that his wife declared she would not he a wife to him, or give up her work and live with him \n\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty with a strong recommendation to mercy on account of extreme provocation.\n\nSentence of death was pronounced.", "authorname": "myhappypenguin", "id": "27286215-8389848029-72157632554929041", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8389848029"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618679}
