Or merely a number of cellars?\n\n&quot;There is an enduring legend that a secret tunnel from the pub's basement to a nearby wharf was used to press-gang drunken patrons onto ships looking for extra crew.

Just a warren of cellars underneath - but we can live in hope that will be found one day :-)\n\nSecret tunnel stories abound in so many locations. For example there was said to be a secret tunnel that ran from Madame Brussels brothel in Little Lonsdale Street to Parliament House in Melbourne - I like that story too :-) \n\nWith regards to the exterior I believe it's actually stayed pretty much the same except for being painted. For example see this 1945 image: <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn4655368\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn4655368</a>\n\nThere are so many of these plans from between 1900 to 1940s that show planned modifications of pubs in Sydney and not all of them actually happened.
