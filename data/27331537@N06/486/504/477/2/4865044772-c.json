I have been doing quite a bit of personal history research on the Rosebank and William Long land grants in Darlinghurst.  Call it a history mission in the making as I live on the old Rosebank Estate and own other properties in the old W Long Estate.  My interest is to assemble as many photos, plans and stories I can find of the original inhabitants, as well as houses, buildings and windmills.  I putting this together for the benefit of the entire neighbourhood and while fairly advanced, there are some definite gaps of knowledge.  I am really intrigued by your ancestry to John Hill and comparing notes and photos.  Hope we can exchange contact soon.", "authorname": "texan-in-australia", "id": "27286215-4865044772-72157629128073868", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4865044772/#comment72157638259242793", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1385935501", "_content": "Yet more ...
