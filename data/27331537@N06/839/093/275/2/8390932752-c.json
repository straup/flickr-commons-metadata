Notwithstanding the huge sums involved, they were essentially cheap and nasty and must have been subject to several rounds of major Great Depression budget cuts by the time they were constructed. Coinciding with the opening of the Bridge (actually they opened a little before the Bridge) it is astonishing that so much public infrastructure was undertaken at the time, and the funds must have been spread quite thinly. Built a decade earlier, Museum and St James Stations were a little more elaborate in detailing and finishes.\nPlatforms only, planned for a (limited) make-over this year. Also Town Hall and Central. They may hold off on Wynyard until Wynyard Walk is complete.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "27286215-8390932752-72157632890545233", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8390932752/#comment72157634920029769", "realname": "Mike Kelly", "path_alias": null, "author": "97539983@N07", "iconserver": "3671", "datecreate": "1375611325", "_content": "The North Shore tram platforms are on the other side of the partition on the far right of the photo.", "authorname": "Shire Mike", "id": "27286215-8390932752-72157634920029769", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8390932752"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618684}
