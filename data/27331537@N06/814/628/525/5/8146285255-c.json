Archives website, also shows the P.O. fence to be timber not chain wire - say photo then is after 1938. \nPhotos online at Nat. Archives show the Kempsey post office during and after the 1949 floods and in 1950 - no big cluttered power pole, chain wire fence in place.\nThe cars and trucks - 1930s models, 2nd car in line could be 1940-41 or 1946-47.\nSo photo I suggest photo taken between 1938 and 1949.", "authorname": "jennys old cars", "id": "27286215-8146285255-72157632154042991", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8146285255/#comment72157632154574227", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1354501796", "_content": "I agree.  I cannot see any postwar cars,  so I would be inclined to narrow that down to 1938-1946.  I think it is summer, because not a single man in the photo is wearing any kind of coat,  although several are wearing ties.   There seem to be quite a lot of men walking around in the street relative to women.  Normally if you look at a shopping street in the daytime, 2/3 of the people walking around are women.  It's either noon or the clock is broken,  so perhaps all those men have just stopped for lunch.  Or it's saturday.  The Wehrmacht officer standing next to the power pole on the left may be a clue.  Above the bus is a sign which appears to be advertising &quot;Briton Radio&quot;  which I have never heard of.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "27286215-8146285255-72157632154574227", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/8146285255/#comment72157632158972074", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1354502807", "_content": "Briton Radios were made in Sydney.
