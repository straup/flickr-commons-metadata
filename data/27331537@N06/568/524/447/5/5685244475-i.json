In 1961, the sale and slaughtering of livestock was regulated by the Meat Industry Board, which also managed the large abattoir complex at Homebush. \n\nThe Board clearly had a substantial budget for education and public relations, as a number of films were produced during the 1950s and 1960s promoting its role in the livestock industry.\n\nThe film 'Meat with care' was produced to show that all aspects of the sale and slaughtering of animals and the processing and handling of carcases at Homebush were carried out in the most efficient and hygienic manner. \n\nSource: <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=\\Series712\" rel=\"nofollow\">NRS 18712</a> Cinematographic films and audio recordings, c. 1960-78 Film -- &quot;Meat with Care&quot;, c. 1961\n\n<a href=\"http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/50-years-at-state-records-nsw/5-07/meat-with-care-a-film/\" rel=\"nofollow\">See the full film here &raquo;</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2401", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-05-03 18:29:18", "lastupdate": "1369941038", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1304472558"}, "originalsecret": "70b313af0a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5304", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5685244475/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620033}
