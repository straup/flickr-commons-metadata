This was generally an unfair character assassination. While occasionally trapping stormy sea foam and flotsam giving the appearance of being unclean, the water inside was in reality not much different to the sea outside the baths walls. \nCouncil had a strict testing program that ensured the water quality and cleaning was carried out at regular intervals during this time. Nevertheless this did not satisfy some people who stridently challenged Great Lakes Council maintenance protocols at every opportunity, perhaps as a means to promote their own agenda to force council to build a 50m pool in Forster. A small number of students were denied permission from their parents to swim in the pool at school PE lessons and swimming carnivals during the 1980's adding to the public pressure on council to build a chlorinated pool. \nOf course the popularised name 'The Bullring' did not help council in their determination to defend their cleaning regime which including oyster shell removal and replacement of sand on the pool floor.\nCouncil eventually committed to building a 25m indoor pool but since then these baths have undergone staged renewal on many fronts and they are now a first class facility enjoyed daily by locals and tourists alike. The baths are barely recognisable today in comparison to the above photo.\nHere are some images of Forster Ocean Baths taken in 2010.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackdiamondimages/4580236566/\" title=\"Ocean Baths - Forster , NSW by Black Diamond Images, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4052/4580236566_b8f8576849_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Ocean Baths - Forster , NSW\" /></a>    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackdiamondimages/4580758945/\" title=\"Ocean Baths - Forster,NSW by Black Diamond Images, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4038/4580758945_fcbf4dcc87_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Ocean Baths - Forster,NSW\" /></a>", "authorname": "Black Diamond Images", "id": "27286215-3489742375-72157633193177920", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3489742375"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682684}
