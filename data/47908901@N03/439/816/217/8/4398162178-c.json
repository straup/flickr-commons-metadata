He did serve as second engineer with the Ropner Shipping Company and sailed on many of their vessels. The last ship he was on was the &quot;S.S.Danby&quot; which was registered in West Hartlepool. When he left the Merchant Navy he spent some time on the Tees Pilot. I would suggest this would have been about the early 1950s.", "authorname": "Stan Laundon \uf8ff", "id": "47885847-4398162178-72157627969880336", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4398162178"}}
