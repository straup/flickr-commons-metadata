Although no human lives were lost during the blaze, it is thought that many animals may have perished during the inferno as they were forgotton or lost by owners rushing to save themselves and their furniture or, spooked by the changes in their surroundings, they ran right into the fire's path. Luckily, this cat appears to have survived unscathed and to have been returned to its owner, who is sitting holding it in the rubble of a fire-damaged building. \n\nPhotograph Collection No : 351\n\nImages from Hartlepool Cultural Services that are part of The Commons on Flickr are labeled 'no known copyright restrictions' indicating that Hartlepool Cultural Services is unaware of any current copyright restrictions on these images either because the copyright is waived or the term of copyright has expired. \n\nCommercial use of images is not permitted.
