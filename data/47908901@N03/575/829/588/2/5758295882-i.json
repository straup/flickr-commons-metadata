Residents can be seen beginning to return to their homes, in an attempt to recover any lost, or undamaged belongings.  Despite the fact that the efforts of firefighters meant that many residents were able to move furniture and other possessions to safety in nearby schools and other buildings, many householders, who were not so lucky,  were still left with nothing. Even those objects which had been resecued were all to often never recovered, lost during the panic and confusion. \n\nPhotograph Collection No : 291\n\nImages from Hartlepool Cultural Services that are part of The Commons on Flickr are labeled 'no known copyright restrictions' indicating that Hartlepool Cultural Services is unaware of any current copyright restrictions on these images either because the copyright is waived or the term of copyright has expired. \n\nCommercial use of images is not permitted.
