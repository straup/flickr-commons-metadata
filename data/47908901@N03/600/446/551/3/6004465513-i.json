They appear to be picking the latest catch up off the sand. Writing in 1951, in his ''History of Hartlepool'', Sir Cuthbert Sharp described the fishwomen as follows:\n\n''The [fish] women perform the most  laborious part of the occupation on shore. They are to be seen on the beach waiting the return of the cobles and carry the lines home; the task of baiting is performed by them, which occupies several hours; they have likewise to procure the mussels from the scalps, and, during the time when the sand eels are on the coast, may be seen in groups on different parts of the shore, going even as far as the mouth of the Tees to procure them.''\n\nPhotograph Collection Number 679"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3090", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-06-29 16:03:46", "lastupdate": "1381068372", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1312365315"}, "originalsecret": "947b80d97e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6014", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/hartlepool_museum/6004465513/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
