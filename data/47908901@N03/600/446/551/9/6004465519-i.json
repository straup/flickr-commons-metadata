In a time when career opportunities for women were extremely limited,  this work was hard. Indeed, the great Hartlepool historian, Sir Cuthbert Sharp, described them as performing:\n\n ''the most laborious part of the occupation on shore. They are to be seen on the beach waiting the return of the cobles and carry the lines home; the task of baiting is performed by them, which occupies several hours; they have likewise to procure the mussels from the scalps, and, during the time when the sand eels are on the coast, may be seen in groups on different parts of the shore, going even as far as the mouth of the Tees to procure them.''\n\nPhotograph Collection Number 680"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2666", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-06-29 15:46:21", "lastupdate": "1385984263", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1312365315"}, "originalsecret": "cef9fc3925", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6141", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/hartlepool_museum/6004465519/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
