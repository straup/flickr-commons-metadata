To the right of the grandstands  across the blvd is the old Kline Kar\nfactory. Appears to have white pillers. Kline Kar! Never Was Built Such A Fine Car! From 1911 to 1923, many of the 6,723 Kline Kars were manufactured in Richmond at a huge North Boulevard factory on the site of the present bus station. The remainder were built where the Omni Richmond stands. \n\nJames A. Kline was a self-taught mechanic and technician who loved motors and making things work. The Richmond Chamber of Commerce persuaded him to move from York, Penn., though Klines company was already in financial trouble. Small regional auto builders were all feeling the pressure of Henry Fords mass-produced reliable, inexpensive black boxes. Klines cars were built and styled by hand.\n\nIn 1915, when Klines bankrupt company reformed, it was putting cars together from shipped-in parts. Kline didnt enjoy it, but he had three kids in college and needed the work. Kline later became the head of the Virginia Branch of the American Automobile Association and sponsored car races. He died in 1944.\n\nHere is a link that shows the front of the building.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vahistorical.org/sva2003/kline.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.vahistorical.org/sva2003/kline.htm</a>", "authorname": "klinehill", "id": "30149331-3595198669-72157625469343654", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3595198669"}}
