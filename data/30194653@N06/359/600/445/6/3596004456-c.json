There is another photo in this stream that shows an aerial view from Broad at the church looking south. You can see this empty lot across from 2501 and the Pohlig box factory, whose dormer windows should help you spot it in the top left of the frame.", "authorname": "Anonnymouse2011", "id": "30149331-3596004456-72157626687856438", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3596004456"}}
