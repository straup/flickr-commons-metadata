It had steel plates running its entire length which your tires rode on. It made a loud singing sound as the weight  of car tires pressed against each one it passed and made this continuing sound until you reached the other side.\n  Also When I heard they were going to tear it down, I asked my dad if he could acquire a section and bring it to our back yard in Bon Air. He did not forget and had to tell all his friends at  Hankins and Anderson.       Barry E.
