Rained so devastatingly hard upriver that the usually lazy Rockfish  became raging torrent , turning the James around . My frriends Robert  and Edith Baber  lost their store .My in-laws Grace and Harry lived just 2 miles from there.GRACE farm  high ground. My Cliff and his father  helped in the recovery of bodies ,was so sad.  I remember the drive back rt.15 to 6 back down to Patterson Ave in Richmond.
