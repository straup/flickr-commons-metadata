Routes 1 or 301, from the north, you traveled down Chamberlayne Avenue to Lombardy, down Lombardy to Broad, left on Broad, and right onto Belvedere to head across the Lee Bridge and onto Cowardin Avenue/Jeff Davis Highway. Northbound traffic did the reverse. There was no direct connection between Belvedere and Chamberlayne and the Lombardy route was, believe it or not, the best and least confusing one.\n\nBefore the construction of the Turnpike, the summertime weekend traffic through Richmond was often gridlocked on the U.S. 1/301 route all the way through the city.", "authorname": "richmondgrocery", "id": "30149331-2899333184-72157622033133694", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2899333184"}}
