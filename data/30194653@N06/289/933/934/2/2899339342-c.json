I'm less certain of the guitar player, but I think it's &quot;Roly-Poly Reid,&quot; aka Reid Summey of the Tags.  A check of the Library's WRVA collection might confirm this.

That is Reid Summey.  The Tags ended in 1949.  From the picture, I assume that Luke and Reid continued to perform together.  My dad, George Wade, was one of the original Three Tobacco Tags, along with Luke and Reid.  They took on another member later and changed the name to just the Tobacco Tags.  The Tags members changed several times during their run.  My dad left in the late 1930's.", "authorname": "mwade303", "id": "30149331-2899339342-72157612237970511", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899339342/#comment72157615489560728", "realname": "Stephanie Fysh", "path_alias": "lu_", "author": "61361160@N00", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1237303589", "_content": "This image and the discussion here have been featured in an Indicommons.org <a href=\"http://www.indicommons.org/2009/03/14/luke-and-partner/\">post</a>.
