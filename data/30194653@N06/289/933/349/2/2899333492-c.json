It was built in the 1940s and was the former home of the Richmond Colts minor league baseball team. If you look closely, you can see the faint outline of a baseball diamond and pitcher's mound inside the track.  \n\nThe Colts left Mooers Field after the 1953 season when Richmond acquired a Triple-A franchise to start playing the following year - the Richmond Virginians (or Vees)..  The Vees played at Parker Field on  North Boulevard, now the site for The Diamond.", "authorname": "vacubsfan", "id": "30149331-2899333492-72157615829667025", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899333492/#comment72157616510125270", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "37182778@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1239209258", "_content": "I knew some old men who talked about racing cars at Mooers Field. One of them also raced in the first Daytona 500 on the sand in Florida. The mechanic was my mother's first cousin and recently died at age 84. The driver is having memory problems but was married another of my mother's cousins. I talked with some other relatives at the funeral and several of them mentioned watching races there in the 50's. I looked this up while thinking about Richmond's lack of baseball this year. I'm glad I found the photo here !
