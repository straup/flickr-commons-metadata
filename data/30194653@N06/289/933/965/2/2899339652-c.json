In good original condition it is easily worth twice the original price.  Some of these had Hydromatic transmissions, a 4-speed automatic.  Others came with a 3-speed manual on the steering column.  Engines were in-line, flatheads, mostly with eight cylinders, but I believe a six was also available.", "authorname": "Howard33", "id": "30149331-2899339652-72157610583096073", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899339652/#comment72157610938397776", "realname": "", "path_alias": "flickrpro", "author": "69287607@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1228794004", "_content": "Twice the original price is wishful thinking !", "authorname": "flickrpro", "id": "30149331-2899339652-72157610938397776", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899339652/#comment72157629278436698", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27309380@N06", "iconserver": "3803", "datecreate": "1332437491", "_content": "A friend of mine bought a 1947 Pontiac four door Silver Streak from an old timer, the guy used it in movies... It turns out it was the principle car in the 1995 film &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot; with Denzel Washington! Ever since he saw that film, he wanted a '47 Pontiac... Well, he now owns THE car he fell in love with. Only set him back $7,000. and the car was in driving condition! :-)\n\nFour doors are always less than coups or two doors. But, I'd say in today's market, a refurbished early post war Pontiac could sell for $10k to $15k. They're good cars, they drive very smoothly. \n\n=R", "authorname": "worldsfair39", "id": "30149331-2899339652-72157629278436698", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2899339652"}}
