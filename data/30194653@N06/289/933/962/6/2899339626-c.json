I graduated from HS in 1983 and in my senior year I took a sociology class. Part of that class was a tour of Spring Street. We went through the entire prison including seeing Old Sparkie with 1 guard. In fact right before we came through an inmate had been found stabbed in the yard. We saw both Briley brothers in C block (a prison inside the prison) playing basketball..it was a pretty awful place. Can you imagine anyone being allowed to do that now? Whoever said they thought they could see the inmates from Belvadiere was right. The rows of cells faced the street and in the summer if you stopped at the light in front of the prison the inmates would yell out at you. Many of the windows were either open or broken. I was there for both executions..across the street sitting on the wall of a house on Oregon Hill.
