My guess is that it is a group to City of Richmond employees (at least one other photo in this collection is identified as such). The reason for this guess is that my mother is the second woman from the right (with the dark collar) on the front row and she was at this time the highest-ranking woman working for the City of Richmond. The second man from the left standing wearing glasses looks like he could well be Alan F. Kiepper, an intern with the City Budget Office at the time who would years later become the City Manager of the City of Richmond. The view out of the window appears to be one of the wings of the State Capitol which supports my claim since this photo would have been taken in what is now known as Richmond Old City Hall.", "authorname": "czaroftourism", "id": "30149331-2898499091-72157627021176932", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2898499091/#comment72157628419250193", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "72079691@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1323888706", "_content": "I think it is City of Richmond employees (Old City Hall) also, look at the building in the background.", "authorname": "Suesue8065", "id": "30149331-2898499091-72157628419250193", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2898499091"}}
