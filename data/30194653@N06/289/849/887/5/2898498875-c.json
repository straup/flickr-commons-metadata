By the early 60s the roads graded but not paved would be finished and an elementary school built.  We lived on Holly Street from 1963-1967, a block from the school.  All of the houses in the newer section were identical, down to the two maple saplings planted on either side of the sidewalk leading to the front door.  The only house that varied from this was the one built for the Kennedy's at the corner of Holly and Carneal.  They (like us) had 7 children and had a house with 4 bedrooms.  All of the other houses were 3 bedrooms with one bath, and eat in kitchen with a walk in pantry/laundry room off it, and a living room.  I'd estimate the total square footage was about 1200 and heated by a single wall heater in the hall between the living room and bedrooms.  The floors were tile over concrete.  But it was a big move for us.  It was the first home our parents bought.", "authorname": "nundu1", "id": "30149331-2898498875-72157628769431417", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2898498875"}}
