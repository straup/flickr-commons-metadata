The Tobacco Bowl football game was part of the National Tobacco Festival, which was held in Richmond every fall from the 1940's to the 1980's. The football game was a pretty good one from time to time - eventually it got to be University of Richmond vs. someone else like Virginia Tech, but good regional teams played in the game from time to time and it was even host for the annual UVA-Tech game. It was not a postseason event.\n\nThe Festival also had a big parade as well as a Grand Marshal for the whole festival. In the old days, that usually meant a pretty decent celebrity because of all of the cigarette advertising and sponsorship on radio and TV. For example, the 1948 Grand Marshal was Frank Sinatra.\n\nIt was a very big deal back in the day.", "authorname": "richmondgrocery", "id": "30149331-2898494211-72157622032958378", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2898494211/#comment72157622044373790", "realname": "", "path_alias": "dmcgrann", "author": "15705594@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1250338789", "_content": "Correction - it appears that Sinatra was the Grand Marshal for 1949.
