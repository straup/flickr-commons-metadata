Before the late 60s cars weren't required to have colapsing steering columns which meant that in a front end collision, the steering wheel was very likely to take your head off. Before the 70s when 5mph crash tests were mandated most cars could not sustain an impact with a brick wall at 5mph without taking major damage. Saftey glass windsheilds didn't keep the passengers inside the car, so it was not uncommon to be thrown from the car, and possibly even be run over by your own car. \n\nThe car in the picture is even less safe than those old &quot;tanks&quot; because it was comparatively tiny and lacked modern innovations such as crush zones which help todays small cars keep their passengers safe even when they collide with something much larger. \n\nAlso to adress the fuel efficiency once again. The nash metropolitan got great fuel mileage for it's time because it was tiny, and had a tiny engine. The lack of emissions controls likely allowed it to get better fuel economy, but also those fuel efficiency claims were made before the EPA got in the business of regulating how fuel efficiency is tested, and most manufacturers claims at the time would have been obtained on a test track at a constant speed under ideal conditions purely for marketing purposes. If the Nash Metropolitan were tested and rated by current EPA standards I highly doubt that it would get 40 mpg.", "authorname": "mattface", "id": "30149331-2898496299-72157612209875508", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2898496299/#comment72157612157963611", "realname": "", "path_alias": "howard33", "author": "62379908@N00", "iconserver": "2531", "datecreate": "1231191009", "_content": "The best kept  secret in those days would really get you some great gas mileage.

We can't really go back without erasing all we now know about how to build better cars.

Partly because the modern chassis is part of what's called a unibody design. the body is integrated into the chassis.
