It is bordered by Broad Street on the south, I-95 on the north, Belvidere Street on the west and 3rd Street on the east. It is located less than a mile from the Virginia State Capitol.\n\n&quot; 'Jackson Ward' was originally the name of the area's political district within the city, or ward, from 1871 to 1905, yet has remained in use long after losing its original meaning.\n\n&quot;As a center for both black commerce and entertainment, Jackson Ward was also called the &quot;Harlem of the South&quot;. Venues there were frequented by the likes of Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole and James Brown.&quot; --<i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Ward\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "30149331-2899343298-72157614423975604", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899343298/#comment72157616352309257", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34931061@N04", "iconserver": "5103", "datecreate": "1239063325", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1070901@N22/\">VINTAGE  COMMERCIAL AND MUNICIPAL VEHICLES</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "RayPa.", "id": "30149331-2899343298-72157616352309257", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899343298/#comment72157633393686767", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "56047933@N00", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1367582353", "_content": "When I lived in Richmond, people from Oregon Hill did not go to Jackson Ward.", "authorname": "will4741", "id": "30149331-2899343298-72157633393686767", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2899343298"}}
