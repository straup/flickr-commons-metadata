The address is 101 E. Franklin Street in downtown Richmond.  The current main library encases the original building shown here, with an addition built in the 1970's.  Unfortunately, the original building was covered with a new facade that provides a unified architectural face to the building.  \n\nJuly 19, 1930:  The Dooley Library shown here opened to the public.  Outside walls were of George Washington stone, quarried at Aquia Creek, Virginia.  Within the building, the walls of the main front stair hall, stairway and the wainscot of the lobby (now the Dooley Foyer) are Italian Montanelle marble.  The walls of the lobby (now the Dooley Foyer), above the wainscot, are of Italian Travatine.  The total cost of the building was $543,000.  Library staff moved 70,000 books and magazines from the old library building to the new one in just 3 days.\n\nDecember 15, 1930:  Dooley Library dedication ceremony.", "authorname": "rpl.virginia", "id": "30149331-2899342638-72157611336785914", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2899342638"}}
