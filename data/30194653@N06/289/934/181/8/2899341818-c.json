The church was established around 1884 as the first Catholic church for people of color in the South. The school began in 1910 as as the Van de Vyver Institute.\n\nThe Catholic Diocese closed both the church and school in 1969 as part of an initiative to integrate Catholic churches and schools. All of the buildings except the convent were torn down; the convent is now a halfway house (Sean House).\n\nThe original church bell has been preserved as part of a small park commemorating the church and school at the site.", "authorname": "richmondgrocery", "id": "30149331-2899341818-72157622053659732", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/2899341818/#comment72157622750327833", "realname": "Carlos Carmonamedina", "path_alias": "carmonamedina", "author": "30885888@N06", "iconserver": "8393", "datecreate": "1259165711", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1225648@N20/\"> School group portrait</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "carmonamedina", "id": "30149331-2899341818-72157622750327833", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2899341818"}}
