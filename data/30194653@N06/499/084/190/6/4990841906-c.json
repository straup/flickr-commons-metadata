This is near Byrd Field, currently known as Richmond International Airport.  The large building in the center would likely have been a new warehouse and/or manufacturing plant.   The pavement surrounding the building appears to be configured for trucking to access the many loading docks and the building seems to have rail access.  The small building center top appears to be a hanger.   The field to the upper right would be the outskirts of the airport.   The baseball field could have been a public field.   As the airport has grown it has transformed the area.", "authorname": "brachism", "id": "30149331-4990841906-72157635346431545", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_virginia/4990841906/#comment72157639050929104", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "58089365@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1388080701", "_content": "Not much of this picture exists anymore.
