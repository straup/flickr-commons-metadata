By 1952 most of the small local airfields were gone.  My first guess had been Hermitage Airport (aka Charles Field, Eagle Rock Airport) which was located near what is today\u2019s I-95/I-64 interchange; but apparently closed c. 1949.   Northfield closed in 1968.   The area today is the Ashbury at Stoneleigh subdivision near the intersection of East Parham Rd and 301.", "authorname": "brachism", "id": "30149331-4990841758-72157635354224554", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4990841758"}}
