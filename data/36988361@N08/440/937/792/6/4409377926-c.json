Somehow I never thought of massive, impressive buildings such as this one being set aflame.\n\nThis is probably the largest and most impressive shul I've seen in photos... far more architecturally attractive than, for example, my own home shul out on Long Island. ... \n\nIt's shots like these these that really make you think, what if it were your shul? what if it happened to you?
