Boys were accepted shortly thereafter. Located in the Jewish colony of Meir Shfeyah, near Zikron Ya\u2019akov, the facility was situated on the site of previous youth facilities. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, or JDC, funded the orphanage through its Palestine Orphan Committee until 1925 when Junior Hadassah, a division of Hadassah for young, unmarried women, took over the responsibility after several years of supporting individual orphans. Meir Shfeyah Youth Village, alternately known as Meir Shfeyah Children's Village, became Junior Hadassah\u2019s largest fundraising project. Junior Hadassah financed the institution\u2019s expenses for three decades until turning over primary responsibility to the State of Israel\u2019s Department of Agriculture in 1958. Although Junior Hadassah merged with other Hadassah divisions in 1967, Hadassah continued to provide support to the Meir Shfeyah Youth Village, which still exists today as a residential, comprehensive high school with an agricultural focus.\n\n<strong>Persistent URL: </strong><a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=300418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=300418</a>\n\n<strong>Repository:</strong> Hadassah Archives, American Jewish Historical Society, 15 West 16th Street, New York, New York\n\n<strong> Parent Collection:</strong> Record Group 18 / Photographs Series Youth Aliyah Subseries Villages YA/Villages/MeierShfeyah/1920s-1940s-001\n \n<strong>Rights Information: </strong>No known copyright restrictions; may be subject to third party rights.
