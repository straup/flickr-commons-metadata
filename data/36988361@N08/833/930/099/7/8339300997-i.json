In addition to chronicling Lenhoff's participation in the association, the collection documents AAEJ's relationships with other activists and organizations; Israeli government officials' responses to AAEJ pressure; requests for help and stories of trauma from the Ethiopian Jews; AAEJ's extensive publicity efforts; and American Jewish press coverage of the struggles of Ethiopian Jewry. The materials include correspondence, clippings, notes, drafts, photographs, audiocassettes and posters. \n\nSelected material from the collection has been digitized and is available through the finding aid for the collection.
