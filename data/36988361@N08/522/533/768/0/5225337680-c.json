Just as an FYI - We don't spread the candles out like that. If it was the fourth night, then the four candles should be on one side. We put the candles in right to left (when you are facing the chanukkiah) and then light the candles left to right. It's not a minhag (custom) or just an Orthodox thing, that is the law around it. Very interesting to see how they laid it out. No doubt the photographer felt it was better symmetry or something. \n\nThese photos are facinating!
