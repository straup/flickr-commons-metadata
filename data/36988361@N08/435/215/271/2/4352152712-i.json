All Nations Basketball Tournament, an annual league event, originated by this Jewish Community Center in 1933, and now in its fifth year, for the purpose of promoting international good fellowship. Representing the different nationalities in our Tournament were Chinese, Japanese, French, Colored, Portuguese and Jewish groups. The idea was so well received by our community that each year different merchants and friends of the Jewish Community Center donate the trophies to us for presentation. Referees also contribute their time and services without fee. They are, as a rule, professional referees. At the close of the Tournament games, we conduct a formal program and invite all the participating teams, local sports writers of the newspapers, athletic directors of the school department, members of our Center Governing Board, and some hero of the moment of the sporting world, who makes the formal presentation of awards. A variety program opens the evening, speeches are made by the different personalities, by the captains of the winning teams, and the program closes, after the awards have been presented, with refreshments. We feel that the Jewish Community Center deserves credit for initiating this All-Nations Basketball Tournament. The growing interest, year after year, by local teams, proves its great influence for better understanding among nationality groups.\n\n<strong>Date:</strong> October 14, 1937\n\n<strong>Medium:</strong> Photograph\n\n<strong>Persistent URL: </strong> <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=209896\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=209896</a>\n\n<strong>Repository: </strong><a href=\"http://www.ajhs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Jewish Historical Society</a>\n\n<strong> Parent Collection:</strong> National Jewish Welfare Board Records\n\n<strong> Call Number: </strong> I-337\n \n<strong>Rights Information: </strong>No known copyright restrictions; may be subject to third party rights.
