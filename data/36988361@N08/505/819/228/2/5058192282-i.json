In the poem the baptized Muslim protagonist Almansor expresses his resentment about Cordova's famous desecrated mosque, now a cathedral, and dreams of seeing it crash vengefully down upon the Spanish congregants below.  The poem is closely related to Heine\u2019s tragedy &quot;Almansor&quot;   which was published in the 1820s. The tragedy is placed in Spain when Christians forced Muslims to convert. As one Muslim character reports in horror of a Koran being burned in the marketplace, another Muslim makes the immortal quote, &quot;That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people as well\u201d Heine was referring to the cruelties of the Spanish Inquisition, but he also intended his audience to draw a more modern parallel, with the exhibitionist book-burning and xenophobia of many German &quot;Romantics.&quot; \n\n<a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=1019236\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read</a> the entire book\n\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Steiner-Prag, Hugo, 1880-1945\n\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Heine, Heinrich, 1797-1856\n\n<strong>Object Origin: </strong>Berlin 1921\n\n<strong>Persistent URL: </strong> <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=1019236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=1019236</a>\n\n<strong>Repository: </strong>Leo Baeck Institute, 15 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011\n\n<strong>Call Number: </strong>r (f) PT 2303 A3 S8\n\n<strong>Rights Information: </strong>No known copyright restrictions; may be subject to third party rights.
