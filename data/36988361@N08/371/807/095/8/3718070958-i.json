He later resided variously in Barbados, Philadelphia, Baltimore and finally New York. Carvalho helped establish a Sephardic congregation, Beit Israel, in Baltimore. \nThis is a portrait of his wife Sarah Miriam Solis (1824-1894). The pair were married in 1845 by the groom's friend, Reverend Isaac Leeser (1806-1868), hazzan of Congregation K.K. Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. Sarah Carvalho was founder and President of the Baltimore Hebrew Sunday School Association. \nCarvalho's sources for the composition (the rich drapery swag to the sitter's left, and the non-specific view through the window to her right) and tonality of this portrait lie ultimately in eighteenth century European painting, filtered through such American painters as Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Sully, with a touch of Victorian sentimentality. It is interesting to note that Carvalho's experience with photographic portraits did not influence this portrait of his wife. \n\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Solomon Nunes Carvalho\n\n<strong>Object Origin: </strong>Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.\n\n<strong>Date: </strong>ca. 1856\n\n<strong>Medium: </strong>oil on canvas\n\n<strong>Persistent URL: </strong> <a href=\"http://museums.cjh.org/Display.php?irn=6589\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://museums.cjh.org/Display.php?irn=6589</a>\n\n<strong>Repository: </strong>Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011\n\n<strong>Call Number: </strong>2003.028\n\n<strong>Rights Information: </strong>No known copyright restrictions; may be subject to third party rights.
