This Institute, originally called the North Caucasus Polytechnical Institute, changed its name many times since its founding in 1918 during the Russian Civil War.  The Krasnodar Institute of Wine-making and Viticulture, along with the Kransnodar Chemical-Technological Institute of Fatty Industry, were the names of the two branches of this Institute from 1938-1943.  The Institute was evacuated to Uzbekistan at some point during World War II because of its value to the state.  It is currently named the Kuban State Technological University, after having obtained university status in 1993.  The University Library currently has over 1 million volumes, and is particularly strong in the sciences.  One of the founders and the first rector of the Institute was Boris Rosing, the developer of one of the first cathode ray television receivers in 1907.  \n\n\nThis book stamp is from a book looted by the Nazis and sorted by Colonel Seymour Pomrenze, one of \u201cthe Monuments Men,\u201d at the Offenbach Archival Depot. \n\n\nThere are two scrapbooks of archival markings from the books sorted at the Offenbach Depot in the Seymour Pomrenze Collection held by the American Jewish Historical Society (Call number P-933) There is a finding aid for the collection <a href=\"http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1463157\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> The digitized scrapbooks are available <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1666403\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1665570\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\n\nFor more information on this project check the Center\u2019s blog: <a href=\"http://blog.cjh.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.cjh.org</a>\n\n\nDr. Mitch Fraas, Acting Director of the Digital Humanities Forum at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries' Special Collections Center is working on a similar project for the German book stamps based on NARA microfilm of the volumes the American Jewish Historical Society currently holds.
