K. A. 9732 (House of the Red Army). A \u201cHouse of the Red Army\u201d was a cultural institution whose function it was to serve the cultural, educational, and recreational needs of Red Army officers and soldiers.  They existed in cities all over the Soviet Union and were renamed Officers\u2019 Garrison Houses in 1946.  This stamp comes from the library from one of these \u201chouses\u201d in Daugavpils, a city in southeastern Latvia.  The first House of the Red Army appeared in 1921, but Daugavpils and the rest of Latvia not part of the Soviet Union at that juncture.  Latvia was occupied by the Soviets from 1940-1941, after which the Germans occupied it. Therefore, this stamp could only have conceivably come into existence in the one-year period of the Russian occupation. \n\nThis book stamp is from a book looted by the Nazis and sorted by Colonel Seymour Pomrenze, one of \u201cthe Monuments Men,\u201d at the Offenbach Archival Depot. \n\nThere are two scrapbooks of archival markings from the books sorted at the Offenbach Depot in the Seymour Pomrenze Collection held by the American Jewish Historical Society (Call number P-933) There is a finding aid for the collection <a href=\"http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1463157\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> The digitized scrapbooks are available <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1666403\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1665570\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\nFor more information on this project check the Center\u2019s blog: <a href=\"http://blog.cjh.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.cjh.org</a>\n\nDr. Mitch Fraas, Acting Director of the Digital Humanities Forum at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries' Special Collections Center is working on a similar project for the German book stamps based on NARA microfilm of the volumes the American Jewish Historical Society currently holds.
