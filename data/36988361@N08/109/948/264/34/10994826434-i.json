Gitlin. Warsaw. Nalevki, Ivanovskiy Bazaar No. 1. Telephone no. 31-59. There were multiple Gitlin publication houses in Warsaw- in addition to \u201cE\u201d, there was also an \u201cA\u201d and an \u201cF\u201d Gitlin, all publishing actively prior to WWII. This stamp is from E. Gitlin, who published the works of Ruben Feldschu, otherwise known as Ben Shem, who was a prominent Warsaw Zionist and activist. Feldschu was one of the most well-known chroniclers of the Warsaw ghetto- he escaped the ghetto with over 800 pages of notes detailing life in the ghetto under Nazi occupation, which he later published.\n\n\nThis book stamp is from a book looted by the Nazis and sorted by Colonel Seymour Pomrenze, one of \u201cthe Monuments Men,\u201d at the Offenbach Archival Depot. \n\n\nThere are two scrapbooks of archival markings from the books sorted at the Offenbach Depot in the Seymour Pomrenze Collection held by the American Jewish Historical Society (Call number P-933) There is a finding aid for the collection <a href=\"http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1463157\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> The digitized scrapbooks are available <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1666403\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=1665570\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\n\nFor more information on this project check the Center\u2019s blog: <a href=\"http://blog.cjh.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog.cjh.org</a>\n\n\nDr. Mitch Fraas, Acting Director of the Digital Humanities Forum at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries' Special Collections Center is working on a similar project for the German book stamps based on NARA microfilm of the volumes the American Jewish Historical Society currently holds.
