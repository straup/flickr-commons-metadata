Magnencij Rabani Mauri De Laudib[us] sancte Crucis opus begins with an introduction by the German humanist, writer, and theologian Jakob Wimpheling (dated 1501) and includes 30 full-page poems printed in red and black and combining woodcut and letterpress. The poems are followed by a transcript in ordinary type for the sake of clarity and a Declaratio explaining the whole arrangement. The encrypted poems are composed in a grid of 36 lines each containing 36 letters. Rabanus sometimes incorporated a figure within the grid, creating both a figurative and a literal picture poem. It continues a late classical tradition in its form: it consists of &quot;carmina figurata&quot; where figures were superimposed on the text so that new verses appear, and these verses have a new meaning. Gustav Mahler composed his 8th symphony around one of Rabanus\u2019s poems (Source: University Library Princeton <a href=\"http://blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2008/05/rabanus_maurus_archbishop_of_m.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.princeton.edu/graphicarts/2008/05/rabanus_maurus_ar...</a>.\nWimpheling was a contemporary of Johannes Reuchlin. There exists a letter written by Mutianus Rufus to Reuchlin in which the printer's achievement is praised in glowing terms; Reuchlin's cooperation and help in the production must have been considerable (Source: H.
