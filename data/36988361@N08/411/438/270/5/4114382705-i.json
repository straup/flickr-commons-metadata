In 1911 the family moved to Berlin, where Uriel volunteered at the &quot;Berliner Sezession.&quot; His graphic and literary output continued throughout World War I, even after he was severely wounded when fighting in the Austrian Army. He returned to traditional Judaism in 1913 and his favorite subject in poetry became trust in God as the principle of human life. He chose to deal with biblical history in order to demonstrate God's relationship to man and published several portfolios and volumes of lithographs and paintings.\n\n<a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=147677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read</a> the entire book\n\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Birnbaum, Uriel, 1894-1956\n\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Zimpel, Julius\n\n<strong>Object Origin: </strong>Wien\n\n<strong>Date: </strong>1921\n\n<strong>Medium: </strong>Artist's illustrated books\n\n<strong>Persistent URL: </strong> <a href=\"http://digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=147677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital.cjh.org/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=147677</a>\n\n<strong>Repository: </strong>Leo Baeck Institute, 15 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011\n\n<strong>Call Number: </strong>r (f) 68\n\n<strong>Rights Information: </strong>No known copyright restrictions; may be subject to third party rights.
