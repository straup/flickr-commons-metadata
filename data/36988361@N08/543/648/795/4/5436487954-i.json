Gertrud Maria Kurth was born in 1904 in Vienna, Austria to Paul and Betty Kurth. Gertrud Kurth was married to Alois Kieslinger from 1924 to 1927. Upon divorcing she returned to her maiden name Kurth. Gertrud Kurth graduated in 1931 with a Ph.D. degree at the University of Vienna, majoring in anthropology. Between 1929 and 1932 she worked as a freelance collaborator of a women\u2019s magazine. She also wrote various articles focused on women\u2019s interests. Between 1928-1937 many of Gertrud Kurth\u2019s short stories were successfully published, and some of them were even dramatized on the radio. From 1934-1938 Gertrud ran her own advertising agency. In 1939 she fled Austria and immigrated to the United States and in 1945 she obtained U.S. citizenship. In 1947 Gertrud Kurth graduated from the New School of Social Research with a Master\u2019s degree in sociology and political science. In 1957 she got her Ph.D. from Columbia University in clinical psychology. She published several papers on psychoanalytical topics. Gertrud Kurth did not have children.
