The second of the wrecks was in November 1862, at Minicoy Reef off India (the SS Columbo, a ship of the Peninsular &amp; Oriental Company), which dates this photo to 1863 (can't have been taken more than a year since that date).  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/.../ArchiveNo14_BabySection.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/.../ArchiveNo14_BabySectio...</a> \n\nSearching around online, items related to the wreck of the Columbo seem to come up for auction occasionally.  Fragments of a journal from the wreck are in the National Library of Australia:\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn786942\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn786942</a>\n<blockquote>\n&quot;The SS Colombo, which was built in 1853, was wrecked on the Minicoy Reef, Laccadive Islands (India) on November 19, 1862. The passengers, many of whom were Australian, and crew spent 11 days on Minicoy or Malacoy before being rescued and given onward passage in the ship 'Ottawa'. Minicoy is the largest island in the 36 islands group southwest of India in the Arabian Sea.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nApparently, hundreds of boxes of mail were rescued from the wreck and delivered in the UK with an understandable delay.
