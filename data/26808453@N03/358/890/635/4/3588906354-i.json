For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;As soon as I opened this album, the first name that came to mind was Julia Margaret Cameron. There's something pre-Raphaelite about this portrait. The lighting is beautiful, the woman is beautiful, everything about this picture pleases me no end. If I could take a portrait like this, I would be thrilled.  It is one of the most beautiful portraits I've seen.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
