For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;I have photographed a lot of triumphal arches, and we even have one in Marble Arch in London, but when you look at the size and beauty of this print, nothing else matters. Also, when you look at this print closely, which would have been made on a gigantic camera, you can see the absolute razor-sharp definition. It makes you so envious to see such quality of work and craftsmanship. It's the sheer size of these prints that makes then so important and so beautiful.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
