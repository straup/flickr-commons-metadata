For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;These are quite famous these columns. Of course they're still there today and I think the background has very much been changed. It's so lovely to think that this person came up with the idea of recording these beautiful objects because we still don't know how many more years they will be allowed to stand before they start crumbling. The slightest tremor from an earthquake could topple this lot down and they would have to be reconstructed. They possibly are some of them reconstructed but they are beautiful and they are memorable. This is one of the most famous of all the images in Rome, apart from the Colosseum of course.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
