For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;There's nothing more graceful than the dhows on the Nile. I've always been fascinated by sailboats of that period. This is another beautiful print by Frith. It's not a big print but it's beautiful enough to immediately arrest my vision. The man was a really great photographer. I suspect that many of these photographers must have surely been inspired by paintings because you can see that it is a perfect composition.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
