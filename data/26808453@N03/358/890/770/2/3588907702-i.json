For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;It goes without saying that Francis Frith is one of my heroes. I have studied him all of my photographic life, which has been nearly fifty years now. Here I am again, looking at new works of his and I am absolutely astounded by the quality, the beauty and the gift of this recorded time. It's the most beautiful picture and I could look at these pictures all day long.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
