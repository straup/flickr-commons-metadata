For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;I think Pompeii is one of the most important sites in the Roman world. It's an extraordinary place for an extraordinary event, Vesuvius  erupting and pouring molten death down on people. I've got a suspicion that the man in the Georgian outfit could possibly be the photographer recording himself in this very important site. I like this picture because it has atmosphere - created by the age of the print itself and the process that was used to make it.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
