For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;I think this is one of the most powerful images in this collection. Once again, the photographer has invited someone to come in, possibly one of the travellers or porters who would have helped to carry some of his equipment, just to show you the scale. It's a most arresting and beautiful image. Surely there can be no more powerful portrait carved in stone in that size. It's so beautiful this picture.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
