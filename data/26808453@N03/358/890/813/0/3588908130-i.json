For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;Maxime Du Camp was, I suppose, on a par with Francis Frith in terms of respect. You can see this photograph is designed to lead us straight into this Temple. If I was photographing this place I would do exactly the same. I would want to take you in by luring you in on this pathway. This is a really beautiful print. It's not an outstanding photograph but it's a very pleasing kind of print. It's something that is quiet and stunningly beautiful.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
