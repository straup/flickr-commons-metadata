For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;It goes without saying that this photograph is very biblical-looking. You couldn't get more closer to looking like Jesus Christ than this man. To find people like this to photograph would be so pleasing. There must be thousands of beautiful, hidden photographs like this in the Collection that you have here. This is only the tip of the iceberg but what a beautiful portrait it is.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
