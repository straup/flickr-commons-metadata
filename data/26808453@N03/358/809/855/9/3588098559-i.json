For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;It's so gigantic this building. It's amazing how people had the imagination to build and construct stuff like this with stone, long before concrete was invented. It was all done by hand and crafted and lifted and hauled up God knows how. This is a very simple image and yet it's actually very, very powerful. Again the print is a total treasure. You can look further and further into these pictures of antiquity. You can't just look at them as a one-off, you have to go deeper and deeper because the depth of field is so extraordinary that there is information even lurking way back in the background and it is needle-sharp.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
