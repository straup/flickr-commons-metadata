For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;Today, if you try to photrograph women in the middle east it's very difficult. There must have been much more relaxed attitudes in those days to photographing women from Islamic backgrounds. You certainly wouldn't be allowed to get away with it today or have the cooperation. There's a very nice innocence about this pictute, an honesty. I could look at these portraits endlessly, they're so beautiful.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
