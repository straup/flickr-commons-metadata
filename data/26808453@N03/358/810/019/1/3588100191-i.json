For his latest project he has photographed archaeological remains around the Mediterranean. On a recent visit to the Museum, to coincide with the opening of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/donmccullin/flickr.asp\">major exhibition of his work</a>, Don made a personal selection of photographs from the National Media Museum's collection, revealing how these sites were recorded by earlier photographers such as Francis Frith and Maxime Du Camp. \n\nDon McCullin: <i>&quot;What Francis Frith has said to himself is - I need to show the scale of these astounding images carved in stone and therefore it would be good to get some living human beings in there - and he's done just that. You can see that there's a slight sense of staging but it does no harm. It's really a beautiful picture and it offers us so much information. That's one of the great things about these photographers, the quality of their work, their  composition, allows us to look forever into these extraordinary prints.&quot;</i>\n\n----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
