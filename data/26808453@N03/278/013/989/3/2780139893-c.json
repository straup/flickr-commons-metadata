The rows of trees here suggests an orchard, the boy with a barrow in the background perhaps with tolls or materials and the man preparing a new rootstock. The woman is mysterious, what is she doing just sitting there? Looking closer she is holding a branch which is what will be grafted onto the rootstock.", "authorname": "Sad Bishop", "id": "26785399-2780139893-72157607084804004", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/2780139893/#comment72157607525701334", "realname": "Jun Liu", "path_alias": "thinkfreedom", "author": "30749824@N04", "iconserver": "2849", "datecreate": "1222481517", "_content": "Like paintings", "authorname": "linkinthink", "id": "26785399-2780139893-72157607525701334", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/2780139893/#comment72157611345202061", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "7724352@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1229700145", "_content": "Yes this would most definitely refer to the grafting of fruit trees.", "authorname": "stefaniacontessa", "id": "26785399-2780139893-72157611345202061", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/2780139893/#comment72157612159962083", "realname": "", "path_alias": "cryptia", "author": "90081436@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1231194331", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/849159@N25/\">Food photography in Black &amp; White</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Cryptia.", "id": "26785399-2780139893-72157612159962083", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/2780139893/#comment72157621591276130", "realname": "", "path_alias": "drakegoodman", "author": "29007475@N08", "iconserver": "5332", "datecreate": "1247814155", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1056855@N21/\">Vintage Background People</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "drakegoodman", "id": "26785399-2780139893-72157621591276130", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/2780139893/#comment72157622772652905", "realname": "", "path_alias": "staticgirl", "author": "69709626@N00", "iconserver": "5470", "datecreate": "1259488667", "_content": "Probably a play on words - a grafter who grafts.
