Why do you suppose there were so many photos of men, say, on a crew team, standing their with their sculls, yet not on the river? Or people standing triumphant on a mountain with skis, rather than schussing down it? It was an impossible shot!\n\nSo, staging photos as they had since its inception (often with a metal rod up the subject's back to prevent movement!) was seen as natural. No doubt, just the presence of people who belonged in a drawing room or men's club, out in the snow or on the high seas, was adventure enough to them!\n\nThat's my guess anyway.
