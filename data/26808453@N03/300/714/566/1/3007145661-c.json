Thanks!\n\nHowever, we would like to offer a constructive remark.\n\nWe are somewhat surprised at the &quot;normal&quot; utilisation of the slang word &quot;boche&quot; in some of the captions (as in this case and also <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007145613/\">here</a> ). During the war, the german soldiers were called &quot;boches&quot; in an undeniably derogatory manner by the french. We feel that if this term is to be used in captions it should be explained or at least appear in quotation marks. If it is, as it seems to be here, the case of a text written by a french soldier then the whole caption should be in quotation marks.", "authorname": "postaletrice", "id": "26785399-3007145661-72157615883546068", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007145661/#comment72157617669545245", "realname": "Luciano Faustino", "path_alias": "lucianofaustino", "author": "37684497@N07", "iconserver": "3303", "datecreate": "1241575386", "_content": "\u201cIt is only the dead who have seen the end of war\u201d\n\n                                                                                          Plat\u00e3o", "authorname": "Luciano Faustino", "id": "26785399-3007145661-72157617669545245", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007145661/#comment72157618126726818", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "32659975@N07", "iconserver": "1355", "datecreate": "1242287689", "_content": "HAHA!!! we OWNED those germans!\n\n\n\n&quot;There was never a good war or a bad peace&quot;", "authorname": "Sgt.
