The wounded on the stretchers are waiting to be taken to the clearing stations; others able to walk are making their way along the road as far as possible. \n\n&quot;Identified are: Major (Maj) G A M Heydon MC, Regimental Medical Officer of the 8th Battalion (fifth from the left with his arm in a sling). To his left is Private W Bain and next to him is Private (Pte) 'Spud' Murphy. To Pte Murphy's left (wearing a pack) is 58 Lance Corporal (LCpl) Roy Arthur Findlay MM, all are members of the 1st Field Ambulance. \n\n&quot;Shortly after the photograph was taken a shell landed in approximately the area where Maj Heydon and Pte Murphy had been standing. The shell killed most of the wounded on stretchers and LCpl Findlay was blown under the truck, shown lying on its side to the right.&quot;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157617334480515", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007144795/#comment72157617895296618", "realname": "Gareth Davies", "path_alias": null, "author": "34409508@N07", "iconserver": "3108", "datecreate": "1241853856", "_content": "what a very sad story, above, war is a terrible thing...", "authorname": "Garboy-Wales", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157617895296618", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007144795/#comment72157620570640436", "realname": "Ross Beckley", "path_alias": "rustie", "author": "61035342@N00", "iconserver": "135", "datecreate": "1245982654", "_content": "This is truely brilliant, thank you so much for showing some of the many Frannk Hurley images.", "authorname": "Rossco ( Image Focus Australia )", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157620570640436", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007144795/#comment72157622244488662", "realname": "Benedek Kiss", "path_alias": "enrowsworkshop", "author": "81286639@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1252102793", "_content": "Thank you for these amazing pics.", "authorname": "KissTheDesigner", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157622244488662", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007144795/#comment72157625063076043", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "54838544@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1287379381", "_content": "thank you thease amazing pics", "authorname": "MIRACLE43", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157625063076043", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/3007144795/#comment72157629330435183", "realname": "", "path_alias": "saroo-hamid", "author": "61154812@N08", "iconserver": "2894", "datecreate": "1329318924", "_content": "I Hate wars", "authorname": "Saroo3", "id": "26785399-3007144795-72157629330435183", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3007144795"}}
