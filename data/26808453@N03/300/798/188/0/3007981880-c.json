Each photo has a typed description of the photo on the reverse. In the case of this particular photo above, the description reads as follows...\n\n&quot;E1889      &quot;Hellfire Corner&quot; on the Menin Road, in the Ypres sector, in Belgium, on September 27th, 1917. This well-named locality was continually under observation, and notorious for it's danger; the neighbourhood was piled with the wreckage of all kinds of transport. A &quot;sticky&quot; spot that was always taken at the trot.&quot;\n\nI hope this is helpful to interested people.", "authorname": "Wandering Ro", "id": "26785399-3007981880-72157629173523782", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3007981880"}}
