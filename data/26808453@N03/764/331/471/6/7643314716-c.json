He developed a very strong attachment to Captain Speedy and his wife. However, Prince Alemayehu grew increasingly lonely as the years went by, and his compromised health made things even harder. He died in October 1879 at the age of 19 without seeing his homeland again. Prince Alemayehu left an impression on Queen Victoria, who said of his death: 'It is too sad! All alone in a strange country, without a single person or relative belonging to him... His was no happy life'.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Alemayehu\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Alemayehu</a>", "authorname": "Alan Denney", "id": "26785399-7643314716-72157635316719086", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "7643314716"}}
