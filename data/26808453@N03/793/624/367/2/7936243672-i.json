Just a few months into his sovereignty he caused controversy by proposing to American socialite Wallis Simpson (1896-1986), who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The Prime Minister opposed the marriage and, had he remained King, it would have compromised Edward\u2019s position as head of the Church of England. Edward abdicated the throne and was never crowned. \n\n\n\n\nThis photograph has been selected from the Daily Herald Archive, a collection of over three million photographs. The archive holds work of international, national and local importance by both staff and agency photographers.\n\n\n\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
