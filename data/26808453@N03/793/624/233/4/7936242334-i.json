Prince Alfred was the second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He was the third Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1893-1900. \n\n\n\n\nRoger Fenton received several commissions to photograph members of the Royal Family, with whom he had a good relationship. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were both enthusiastic patrons of photography.\n\n\n\n\nRoger Fenton was a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and one of the most influential photographers of the 1850s. He is best known as one of the first war photographers, from his work in the Crimea in 1855.  However, he also took many highly-regarded photographs of the Royal Family and the collections of the British Museum as well as many superb landscapes, architectural studies and still lifes.\n\n\n\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
