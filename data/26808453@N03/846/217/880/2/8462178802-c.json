The north end group, Nos. 57-62, up to the former Queen\u2019s Hotel, is of ca. 1868.   \nOn the shore, just south of the Queen\u2019s Hotel, was the nineteenth-century Public Bath, built in  1810 and demolished in 1892. The former Queen\u2019s Hotel, now Ceredigion County Offices and  home of Ceredigion Archives, was designed by architects Hayward and Davis in a \u2018H\u00f4tel de Ville\u2019 style and built by George Lumley of Aberystwyth for the Hafod Hotel Company or Mid Wales Hotel Company. It was opened in 1866. The plans were signed by Davis, and the hotel is contemporary with, though more stolid than, Hayward\u2019s Duke of Cornwall hotel in Plymouth, \nlacking the virtuoso roofscape of the Plymouth building. The Cambrian News published visitor lists during the summer months and noted that the 83-bedroom hotel had special ground-floor provision for the infirm. Quartz and ore panels are retained beneath the ground-floor windows, and there is extravagant stained-glass on the mezzanine. Vestiges of former splendour remain in the Archives search room, with its acanthus plasterwork, mantelpiece and mirror, and in the former New Assembly rooms, now the \u2018Cambrian Hall\u2019, with \u2018Q H\u2019  on the iron spandrels.  Post-1945 the hotel was converted by G. R. Bruce, County Architect, into the County Offices.  </i> \n\nI think it's County Offices\nMarine Terrace\nAberystwyth\nCeredigion\nSY23 2DE\nand I think this view is from what is now Albert Place?\n<a href=\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aberystwyth&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.419688,-4.084267&amp;spn=0.001405,0.004128&amp;sll=52.258749,-2.157401&amp;sspn=0.022459,0.066047&amp;oq=aberyst&amp;hnear=Aberystwyth,+Ceredigion,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.419689,-4.084098&amp;panoid=FuJmeQMOyV98W-SXAbkGfA&amp;cbp=12,336.13,,0,-1.11\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Aberystwyth&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52....</a>", "authorname": "Ruth Flickr", "id": "26785399-8462178802-72157632737551914", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8462178802/#comment72157632733757069", "realname": "Roger Boyle", "path_alias": "rogerdboyle", "author": "46733878@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1360528827", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum] \n\nyep - it's the ex-archive building.  unmissable still.", "authorname": "rogerdboyle54", "id": "26785399-8462178802-72157632733757069", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8462178802/#comment72157632745989722", "realname": "National Media Museum", "path_alias": "nationalmediamuseum", "author": "26808453@N03", "iconserver": "8189", "datecreate": "1360603315", "_content": "Thanks everyone... have updated the location here and will add to our records.\n- Emma", "authorname": "National Media Museum", "id": "26785399-8462178802-72157632745989722", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "8462178802"}}
