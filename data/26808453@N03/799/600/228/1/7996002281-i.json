He began making films in 1897, establishing a \u2018film factory\u2019 in Hove.  Smith\u2019s films were distributed by the Warwick Trading Company and he also printed their films. \n\nSmith was critical of Turner\u2019s projector, which he could not get to register the images. He abandoned work on the process in 1904 and turned instead to develop a two-colour process which he patented in 1906. This was launched with Urban in 1908 as Kinemacolor, the first commercially successful colour moving picture process. \n\nThis would have been the end of the story had the roles of film not been rediscovered at the National Media Museum. \n\nClick on to the next picture to find out what happened next.\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons.
