This father and daughter team of photographers were elected quite late in the life of the Linked Ring Brotherhood. Rudolf opened an atelier for artistic photography in Hamburg, in 1883. He studied the great masters of portrait painting, and followed their principles in terms of composition and lighting. The father and daughter worked very closely together, and it is not unusual for their work to be co-attributed.\n\nJohn Furley Lewis (1867 - 1939) was born in Nottingham. He became involved in photography at Cambridge in 1883. From 1893, he worked for a St. Albans printers, working on new colour printing techniques. He took over Frank Brangwen's photographic studio in Kensington, working as a portrait photographer. Elected member of the RPS in 1899; admitted FRPS in 1904; awarded Hon. FRPS in 1918, RPS President 1914 to 1916.\n\n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3038", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1908-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1381487591", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1358362156"}, "originalsecret": "4a65bfd409", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8081", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8385715235/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
