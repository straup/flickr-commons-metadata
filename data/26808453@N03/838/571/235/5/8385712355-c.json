It may be a negative copy, but I do suspect that it's the original. I also have a second image of the same group. I have been told by the Royal Academy that it was taken in Burlington House, but <a href=\"http://erps.dmu.ac.uk/catalogue_all.php?enid=1902\" rel=\"nofollow\">the catalogue</a> suggests it was actually at  The New Gallery, 121 Regent Street. Fantastic to now know when it was and who they all are.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsthatpicture/4980022193/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsthatpicture/4980022787/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "whatsthatpicture", "id": "26785399-8385712355-72157632584308667", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8385712355/#comment72157632585816881", "realname": "National Media Museum", "path_alias": "nationalmediamuseum", "author": "26808453@N03", "iconserver": "8189", "datecreate": "1358895372", "_content": "Excellent work James.
