Bland, J. C. S. Mummery, Lt. Colonel Joseph Gale; and seated, E. Sanger-Shepherd, William Cooke, Dr. Peter Henry Emerson, Sir William Abney.\n\nWilliam R. Bland (1851 - 1929) was an amateur pictorial photographer who worked as a banker throughout his life. He took up photography age 40 and became an active part of the local photography community. He exhibited and judged competitions including for the Royal Photographic Society of which he was a fellow. His work was influenced by photographer J. Page Croft.\n\nColonel Joseph Gale (1830 - 1906) was a member of the Royal Photographic Society before becoming one of the first members of the Linked Ring Brotherhood in 1892, where he went by the name of 'Rambler'. His approach to photography tended to be naturalistic rather than picturesque, taking particular care in the composition of his subjects.\n\nE. Sanger-Shepherd (1900 - 1927) was a prominent photographer who founded Sanger-Shepherd and Company Ltd. (based at 5 - 7 Gray's Inn Passage, Red Lion Street, Holborn, London). The company specialised in colour equipment, filters, sensitometry and scientific areas of photography. The company was wound-up after Sanger-Shepherd's death.\n\nPeter Henry Emerson (1856 - 1936), baptized Pedro Enrique, spent his early childhood in Cuba but moved to England in 1869. He studied medicine, and he took up photography in 1882; publishing photographic works and works on theory, including 'Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads' (1886) and 'Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art' (1889).  Emerson's strong views on naturalistic photography brought him in to conflict with (amongst others) Henry Peach Robinson. In the 1890s Emerson became disillusioned with the concept of photography as an art. He became an elected member of the RPS in 1882; admitted FRPS in 1859; awarded RPS Progress Medal in 1895.\n\nSir William de Wiveleslie Abney (1843 - 1920) was a civil servant and a photographic scientist.\n\n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4649", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1902-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1388319546", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1358362189"}, "originalsecret": "0dab1f3e88", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8510", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8385712355/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
