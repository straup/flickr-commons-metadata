He studied chemistry at Anderson's College in Glasgow from 1878 - 1879. He worked in the family\u2019s photography firm. He travelled to Vienna in 1883 and was taught the process of photogravure by Karl Kl\u00edc. Annan made photogravures from calotypes of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson; c. 1891 he moved onto portrait photography, photographing Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Ellen Terry and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nBorn in Boston Massachusetts, Fred Holland Day (1864 - 1933) was a prominent American photographer and his lifelong passions were literature, art, photography and aesthetics. He first trained as a painter; co-founded and self-financed the publishing firm of Copeland and Day (1893 - 1899); took up photography in 1887; regularly travelled to London and established links with the British photographic scene, joining the Linked Ring in 1896. By the 1890s Day had become one of the undisputed leaders of the American art photography movement. A millionaire book publisher and aesthete, he was a friend of Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900) and Aubrey Beardsley (1872 - 1898). In 1900 Day organised a photographic exhibition 'The New School of American Photography' which was shown in London and created a sensation. He ceased taking photographs around 1915.\n\n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3481", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1362955811", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1358362158"}, "originalsecret": "1de4e59da0", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8047", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8385714929/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
