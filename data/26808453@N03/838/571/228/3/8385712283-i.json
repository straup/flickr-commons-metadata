Cadby, Carine Cadby, Alvin Langdon Coburn and Ward Muir. All were members of the Linked Ring Brotherhood, and Carine Cadby was (along with Gertrude Kasebier) the first elected female member of the brotherhood. The photograph was taken by Coburn's mother Fannie Coburn. \n\nDuring his early career William Cadby (1866 - 1937) concentrated on photographing landscapes and children, later expanding into adult portraiture. He was especially noted for his delicate and sympathetic portrayal of childhood. W. A. Cadby became a member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood in 1895. Both he and his wife wrote extensively in the photographic press.\n\nCarine Cadby (1856 - 1967) was widely seen as the most successful photographer of flowers during the early twentieth century, her work frequently appearing in photographic magazines of the time. C. Cadby became a member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood in 1900.\n\nAlvin Langdon Coburn (1882 - 1966) first exhibited in London with the RPS in 1900. After studying in Paris, Coburn returned to his native America in 1902, where he opened a studio in New York. Between 1903 and 1909 many of his works were published in the journal 'Camera Work'. Coburn's impressionistic images were heavily influenced by the Linked Ring Brotherhood. In 1917 he pioneered vortographs, an abstract work produced using mirrors in a vortoscope, rather like a kaleidoscope. In 1930 he moved from the USA, to Harlech in north Wales and was naturalized as a British citizen in 1932. From 1923 to 1930 Coburn became completely devoted to the life of the Universal Order: a comparative religious group that had begun in 1911 as the Hermetic Truth Society and the Order of Ancient Wisdom. Coburn became an elected member of the RPS in 1907; admitted FRPS in 1913; awarded Hon. FRPS in 1931, and was a member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood.\n\nWard Muir (1828 - 1987) aka 'Penny-a-liner', took views of street life in London. He became a member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood in 1902.\n \n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4685", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1906-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1388319544", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1358362190"}, "originalsecret": "acf490fcb7", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8518", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8385712283/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
