He studied and practiced law but an inheritance gave him the independent means to pursue his interest in art and he took up photography in 1852. Fenton was a founding member of the (Royal) Photographic Society and one of the most influential photographers of the 1850s. He is best known as one of the first war photographers, from <a href=\"http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/remembrance-day-part-1-photographing-war-fenton-crimean/\" rel=\"nofollow\">his work in the Crimea in 1855</a>. However, he also took many highly-regarded photographs of the Royal Family and the collections of the British Museum as well as many superb landscapes, architectural studies and still lifes. In 1862 he gave up photography without explanation, sold his cameras and negatives at auction, and returned to practicing law.\n\n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3389", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1860-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1385856527", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1358362175"}, "originalsecret": "fec871a3c8", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8221", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8386799824/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
