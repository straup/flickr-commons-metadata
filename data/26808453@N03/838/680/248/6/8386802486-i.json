He bought his first camera in 1883 for photomicroscopic and landscape photography. George Smith, owner of the Sciopticon Company, made lantern slides from Evans's negatives. In 1887 Evans received the Photographic Society of London's medal of honour for his photomicrographs. He had a lifelong engagement with the photography of cathedral architecture. In 1891 he was elected a member of the London and Provincial Photographic Association. Evans bought into a partnership of a bookshop owned by Edward Jones c. 1890, which Evans latter inherited on Jones' death. He retired from the bookshop in 1898, giving his full attention to the making of fine photographs and writing critical and technical articles on his chosen medium, the platinum print. He was elected to the Linked Ring Brotherhood in 1900 and he held a one-man show of his photographs at the Royal Photographic Society in April 1900. In 1903 his work was featured in Alfred Stieglitz's magazine 'Camera Work'. Elected honorary fellow of RPS in 1928.\n\n-----\n\nWe're happy for you to share this digital image within the spirit of The Commons, although certain restrictions apply. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/photography/copyright.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">More about reproductions and image licensing</a>\n\nFor obtaining reproductions of selected images, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science and Society picture library</a>, which represents the visual collections of the National Media Museum, the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2935", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1915-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1363394083", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1358362150"}, "originalsecret": "bdcb6d2b08", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8088", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8386802486/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
