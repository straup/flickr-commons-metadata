A famous English writer and poet, he set his novels against the bleak imaginary landscape of Wessex, modelled on the Dorset countryside of his birth.  After the success of Far From the Madding Crowd in 1874, he devoted himself producing a series of novels, among them Tess Of The D'Urbervilles (1891) and Jude the Obscure (1896).\n\n\n\n\nThis photograph appears in 'The Cabinet Portrait Gallery' series of celebrity portraits and biographies published in the 1890s.
