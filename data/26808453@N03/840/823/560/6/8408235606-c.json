He was trying to systematize the understanding of mental illness based on the facts that he could observe.  The fact that he was largely wrong about the principles of physiognomy doesn't mean that he wasn't trying to care for his patients.  At least he wasn't trying to exorcise them or condemn them as witches.\n\nI wonder if, in fact, a modern neurologist couldn't make some sort of preliminary diagnosis based on these photographs.  Remember too that when we call this girl &quot;charming&quot; and the Doctor &quot;narcissistic&quot; based on their photos, we are practicing a form of physiognomy ourselves.", "authorname": "puzzlemaster", "id": "26785399-8408235606-72157632596821036", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8408235606"}}
