The building was taken over by the city in 1917 when the YMCA had difficulty paying their bills (Lethbridge and western Canada went into a recession in 1913 following the real estate bust and this was exacerbated by the First World War).  The YMCA was able to get back the building in the 1920s.  But by the 1960s the building was considered much too small.  For example, the swimming pool was located in the basement of the building and was considered grossly insufficient by the 1960s.  In the 1960s the YMCA entered a new fundraising phase and was able to build the location now on Stafford Drive.  This older building was knocked down not long after the move to the new location.", "authorname": "Galt Museum & Archives on The Commons", "id": "23663808-5448289813-72157626237606010", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5448289813"}}
