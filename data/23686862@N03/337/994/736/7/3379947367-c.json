This photo was published in the Lethbridge Herald when Mom and her team won the Aird Trophy at the Ladies Curling Club in the 1950s. \nBoth my parents were avid curlers.  My father was President of the Lethbridge Curling Club in 1958/59.  My mother curled in bonspiels all across southern Alberta - often bringing home the prize.  \nOur family heritage is Scottish so it followed that my ancestors were involved in the game of curling - even on the natural ice of Sylvan Lake, AB.", "authorname": "curatorwja", "id": "23663808-3379947367-72157623581673900", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/galt-museum/3379947367/#comment72157626597231839", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "60305093@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1305425614", "_content": "The lady on the lower step is Kay Jamieson.  My family lived next to the Jamieson's in Lethbridge  in the late 40's. I believe we moved away when I was four (1951), but we maintained a connection with the Jamieson's throughout their lives. Would love to connect with their children. Have the fondest memories of Wally and Kay.
