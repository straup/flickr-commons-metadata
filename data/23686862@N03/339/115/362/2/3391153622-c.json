But the date of the subject matter is correct.  It's just that Brown asserted his rights to the picture as the holder of the negative, even though he didn't take it.  \n\nBrown purchased the original negative collections of many prairie photographers, including pictures taken by Charles Wesley Mathers and the Calgary outfit Boorne and May; his images go back to the 1870s.  \n\nThis picture was one of Brown's favorites.
