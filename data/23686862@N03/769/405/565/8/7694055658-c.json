The man on the far left is Jack King. The woman on the far right is his wife of 70 years, Mrs Ellen King (nee May). They are my husband's grandparents. I talked to them both at their 70th anniversary party. They said they remember it was an event for the Green Acres Kiwanis foundation. They also agreed that it was in the early 40s. Probably after they were married in 1942 but before their first son was born in 1945. They couldn't recall the names of the people they were sitting with. Jack was one of the original founders of King and May Electric, which later became King Electric.\nAmanda King", "authorname": "Amanda King 1978", "id": "23663808-7694055658-72157632031001021", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/galt-museum/7694055658/#comment72157632047534345", "realname": "", "path_alias": "galt-museum", "author": "23686862@N03", "iconserver": "3089", "datecreate": "1353344928", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/90186759@N04] Hi Amanda, that is fantastic, thank you so much for solving this mystery for us!
