The origins of this are obscure. It appears to have been adopted after Waterloo, however prior to this the 105th had an 'English' style Bugle horn with a loop. In its centre is the White Rose of York, linking to the regiment's home in Yorkshire. Unusual amongst British Army regiments, the badge lacks a crown. It was also the smallest cap badge used in the British Army.\n\nThe KOYLI had two battaliopns in the 62nd (West Riding) Division, which went onto occupation duty at Schleiden. The battalions were the 2nd/4th and the 5th, so presumably these men belonged to one or the other battalions, as it does not seem other battalions of this regiment went onto occupation duty.\n\nTwo men have wound stripes on their sleeves - left most man has two and second from right has three, each stripe attesting to the number lf times they had been wounded in action.", "authorname": "fulvue", "id": "23663808-3400275164-72157629315905321", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/galt-museum/3400275164/#comment72157631914655743", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "89639849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1351903526", "_content": "Trimaksi y!", "authorname": "hermanherggorumpaidus", "id": "23663808-3400275164-72157631914655743", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/galt-museum/3400275164/#comment72157634761437656", "realname": "Sheamus Warior", "path_alias": null, "author": "98369008@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1374564385", "_content": "Hi, I really need the information more as you have provided in this valuable blog.\n<a href=\"http://www.crabrevenge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">how to get revenge</a>", "authorname": "Sheamus125", "id": "23663808-3400275164-72157634761437656", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3400275164"}}
