The facility ceased to operate 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the South Seas brought back a collection of plants. A new greenhouse was constructed in 1850 and moved to its present location on Independence Avenue between First and Third Streets in 1933"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3303", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:47:50", "lastupdate": "1244043630", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229270"}, "originalsecret": "97af27d00a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3568", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3360757322/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
