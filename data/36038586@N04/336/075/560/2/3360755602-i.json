He was elected twice, in 1896 and 1900, but was assassinated in 1901 at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He fought the Spanish-American War to liberate Cuba, and afterwards annexed the Philippines and Puerto Rico, as well as Hawaii. He promoted high tariffs as a formula for prosperity, helped rebuild the Republican party in 1896 by introducing new campaign techniques, and presided over a return to prosperity after the Panic of 1893. He was succeeded by his Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n1901"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7348", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:47:12", "lastupdate": "1380290866", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229232"}, "originalsecret": "0d3ed3ac95", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3644", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3360755602/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
