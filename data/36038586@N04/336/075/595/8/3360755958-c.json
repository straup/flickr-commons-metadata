The Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized Congress to fund the Federal Triangle project, a large-scale initiative to develop a 70-acre site between the White House and the U.S. Capitol with federal buildings executed in classical styles of architecture.\n\n&quot;At the urging of the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Treasury Department turned over principal design responsibilities to private architects. Edward H. Bennett of the Chicago firm Bennett, Parsons and Frost oversaw the project and designed the final building, which would become the headquarters for the FTC.\n\n&quot;In 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid the building cornerstone ... In his speech, Roosevelt expressed hope that the 'permanent home of the Federal Trade Commission stand for all time as a symbol of the purpose of the government to insist on a greater application of the golden rule to the conduct of corporation and business and enterprises in their relationship to the body politic.'\n\n&quot;Located at the eastern point of the Federal Triangle, it was originally called the Apex Building. Staff moved into the building on April 21, 1938. Over the years, the FTC's responsibilities expanded to include the enforcement of credit laws, oversight of the National Do Not Call Registry, and the development of policies concerning Internet fraud and privacy.&quot; <i>&mdash; <a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/buildingView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=/ep/channel/gsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-25241&amp;bid=610\">GSA</a></i>\n\n\n<b>Federal Trade Commission &ndash; Then and Now</b> (60+ years later)\n\n&quot;Federal Trade Commission (2007)&quot; by <i>J.Labrado</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/18857561@N06/2720857046/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3066/2720857046_e8bddc6855_m.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Trade Commission,  Washington DC\" alt=\"Federal Trade Commission,  Washington DC by 18857561@N06\" /></a>\n\n\n&quot;Apex Building (c.1945)&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;by <i>E.B.
