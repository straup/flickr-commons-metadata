Brumidi was an Italian-American artist who painted the most important frescoes in the United States Capitol. Born in Italy, he was one of the leading artists of Rome and nearly 50 years old when he moved to the United States in 1852. Thomas U. Walter, the architect of the U.S. Capitol, and Montgomery Meigs, the engineer charged with constructing the Capitol*s dome and extensions, both recognized Brumidi as the best living fresco artist and selected him to decorate the building*s interior. Brumidi*s classical training, his study of history, and his devotion to his new homeland combined to create such works as The Apotheosis of Washington in the Rotunda.\n\nCreator: Mathew Brady\n\nCa. 1870"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "6820", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:48:30", "lastupdate": "1366053224", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229310"}, "originalsecret": "418ff22b60", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3627", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3360758854/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
