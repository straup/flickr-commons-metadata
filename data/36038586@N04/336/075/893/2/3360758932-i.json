Thornton's design for the Capitol had been submitted after the close of a competition in which 17 entries were found wanting. His plan was approved on July 25, 1793, with the award of $500 and a city lot in Washington, D.C.. Another notable design by Thornton is the Tayloe House (also known as the Octagon House), once headquarters of the American Institute of Architects. Thornton was also the first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office from June 1, 1802 until his death in 1828.\n\nCa. 1800"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7566", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:48:32", "lastupdate": "1239746302", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229312"}, "originalsecret": "3471f6e626", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3626", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3360758932/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
