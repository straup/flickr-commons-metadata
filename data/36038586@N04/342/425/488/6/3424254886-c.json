Also known as &quot;Dickey's Farm House&quot;, and earlier (1802) as &quot;Meyers Tavern.&quot;  I'd guess the photo is late 1800's; the tavern burned in 1950.\n\n&quot;For about 165 years this inn stood near the Great Falls, an original part of the vanished canal town of Matildaville, established in 1790.\n\n&quot;Dickey's Inn, named after the last family that ran it until it closed in 1935, is believed to be the same building in Matildaville owned and operated by the widow Meyers in 1802, and built even earlier. Meyers Tavern was a place of refreshment for canal boat runners and visitors. Reputedly, U.S. presidents from George Washington to Theodore Roosevelt ate in this whitewashed building.\n\n&quot;Henry &quot;Lighthorse Harry&quot; Lee, father of Robert E. Lee, leased 400-500 acres of land along the Potomac from the mouth of Difficult Run in 1793 from George Washington's friend, (the then Reverend) Bryan Fairfax. On forty acres of this land, in 1790, the town of Matildaville was established. Lee named the promising town after his lovely young wife, Matilda Lee, who had recently died.\n\n&quot;The town of Matildaville was neatly laid out in one-half acre lots. The two main streets parallel to the canal were Canal Street and Washington Street. The town had quarters for workers, a two-story superintendent's house, a market house, a sawmill, a gristmill, an ironworks, among other structures. In 1839 the Virginia Legislature disestablished the town, after the canal was abandoned in 1830.&quot; &ndash;<i><a href=\"http://www.gfhs.org/pics/dickeys.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Falls Historical Society</a></i> (also has more photos on-line)\n\nOn the Maryland side of the Falls, the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/choh/planyourvisit/greatfallstavernvisitorcenter.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Falls Tavern</a> is one of the C&amp;O Canal's most impressive structures.", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "36006447-3424254886-72157616829501334", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3424254886/#comment72157617259741596", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "35987476@N06", "iconserver": "3132", "datecreate": "1240583987", "_content": "Th eway photo is taken - the tree with its outstreched arms protects the background, or else the impression is of ageing wood.", "authorname": "loratamosiuniene", "id": "36006447-3424254886-72157617259741596", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3424254886/#comment72157619553769430", "realname": "christin boggs", "path_alias": "christinboggs", "author": "30386478@N00", "iconserver": "2594", "datecreate": "1244653563", "_content": "Do you know what year this photograph was made and/or the name of the photographer?", "authorname": "christinboggs", "id": "36006447-3424254886-72157619553769430", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3424254886/#comment72157619883070155", "realname": "Nasser", "path_alias": "nasser1", "author": "39346077@N06", "iconserver": "3561", "datecreate": "1245457085", "_content": "great pic ...", "authorname": "|| Lazy N ||", "id": "36006447-3424254886-72157619883070155", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3424254886/#comment72157620255491872", "realname": "christin boggs", "path_alias": "christinboggs", "author": "30386478@N00", "iconserver": "2594", "datecreate": "1245703606", "_content": "Curiously, other photos of Dickey's Inn (c. 1900 and 1936) from Deborah Cannan's book Land Above the Falls (published 1992) and the photos for which Pixel Wrangler provided a link show &quot;A-frame&quot; roofs on the added side-rooms, not the &quot;lean-to&quot; structures seen here.
