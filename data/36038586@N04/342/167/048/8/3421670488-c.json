When George Bush came to Appleton, the Post-Crescent newspaper declared it was the first time a &quot;sitting president&quot; had come to town.  My grandfather straightened the newspaper out, which was duly acknowledged in a follow up article.  \n\nPauline was from Kenosha, Wisconsin.  The original detailed New York Times newspaper article about Pauline can be viewed at:\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9507E3DD1F39E333A25756C2A96F9C946196D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9507E...</a>", "authorname": "Mouserola!", "id": "36006447-3421670488-72157616785104737", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3421670488/#comment72157616908402804", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pace_place_pics", "author": "55021897@N00", "iconserver": "31", "datecreate": "1239959232", "_content": "Cow controversy!
