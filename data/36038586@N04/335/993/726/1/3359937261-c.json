This idea was conceived as an impressive government exhibit for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Columbian_Exposition\" rel=\"nofollow\">1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n</a>\nThe tree was cut in the General Grant National Park &ndash; which is now <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/seki/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kings Canyon National Park</a> in California. A team of twenty cutters worked for seven days, fifty feet above the ground, to cut the 26-foot diameter tree.\n\nWorkers then hollowed out the stump, and cut the tree into some 2-3 dozen sections, which would be reassembled on the site of the exposition &ndash; complete with an interior circular staircase!\n\nIn 1894 the tree was moved again to the grounds of the Agriculture Building, on the Mall in Washington, DC. It was then that the structure was made waterproof with the addition of a peaked roof and four dormer windows, and covered with redwood shingles.\n\nThe tree house remained on the mall until 1932, when it was placed in storage at the Agriculture's Experimental Farm in Arlington, VA. In 1940 the Farm was transferred to the Army  for part of the Pentagon grounds, and the tree was likely burned at that time.\n\nLike many government stories, this one has it's irony:  the tree was named to honor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willock_Noble\" rel=\"nofollow\">General John Willock Noble</a> (1831\u20131912)  who served as Secretary of the Interior from 1889-1893. Noble worked diligently to assure the passage of an 1891 law to preserve millions of acres of western forests owned by the federal government.  (Perhaps the loss of this tree used for a &quot;trade show&quot; (exposition) can be excused. ;)\n\n\n&quot;Workers hollowing out the tree to build a \ncircular staircase on the inside of the tree.&quot; \n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=DOYMhOGkCaAC&amp;pg=PT77&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ots=DQdSuGCRaq&amp;sig=ACfU3U3lRP1iPTSb6BFlyT744omVUou5MA&amp;w=685\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=DOYMhOGkCaAC&amp;pg=PT77&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ots=DQdSuGCRaq&amp;sig=ACfU3U3lRP1iPTSb6BFlyT744omVUou5MA&amp;w=185\" alt=\"General Noble Redwood Tree house\" width=\"185\" height=\"185\" alt=\"General Noble Redwood Tree house\" /></a>\n &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Click image to see it full size.\n \n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=DOYMhOGkCaAC&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;ots=DQdSuGCRaq&amp;dq=General Noble Redwood Tree House&amp;pg=PT75\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click Here</a> (and scroll down) to see other related construction photos of this tree house.</i>\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=DOYMhOGkCaAC&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;ots=DQdSuGCRaq&amp;dq=General Noble Redwood Tree House&amp;pg=PT75\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference</a>: <i>Works in progress</i> by Alvin Rosenbaum, Diane Maddex, and Gretchen Smith Mui.
