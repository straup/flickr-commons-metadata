Alice led an unconventional and sometimes controversial life, and despite her love and admiration for her legendary father, she proved to be almost nothing like him. She was not faithful in her marriage, she spurned Christianity, once considered accepting the offer to be &quot;an honorary homosexual&quot; in the late 1960s, temporarily became a Democrat during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and proudly boasted in a 60 Minutes interview that she was a &quot;hedonist.&quot; Nicholas Longworth (November 5, 1869-April 9, 1931) was a prominent American politician in the Republican Party during the first third of the 20th century. He served as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1925 to 1931.\n\nCa. 1905"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3573", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:47:04", "lastupdate": "1340145104", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229224"}, "originalsecret": "13e014eaba", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3630", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3359937371/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
