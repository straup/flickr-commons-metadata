The facility ceased to operate 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the South Seas brought back a collection of plants. A new greenhouse was constructed in 1850 and moved to its present location on Independence Avenue between First and Third Streets in 1933.\n\nView of a walk at the US Botanic Garden looking at the US Capitol dome.\n\nNational Mall between first and third streets\n\nCa. 1923"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3919", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-16 13:48:07", "lastupdate": "1366733802", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237229287"}, "originalsecret": "1ec5611b80", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3620", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/3359940005/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
