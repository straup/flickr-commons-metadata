In this view one can see the grass terrace and older stairs dating from renovations done by Charles Bulfinch.\n\nNote also the train crossing the Mall at Seventh Street. The curvilinear walks and plantings date from the 1850s when this immediate part of the Mall was laid out by landscape designer A.J.
