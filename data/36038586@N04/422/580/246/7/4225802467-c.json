At the time this image was taken and for most of its life, it was known simply as &quot;The Smithsonian Institution&quot;. Until the 1880s when the &quot;other brick building&quot; was completed as the U.S. National Museum (now known as the Arts &amp; Industries Bldg.), that was enough. After the &quot;new&quot; museum, Natural History, opened in 1910, it got more complicated. Then MHT/NMAH in 1964, and so on. Now this is generally known as &quot;The Castle&quot;, but, of course, it never was one. I doubt it was called &quot;the castle&quot; in 1900, the likely date of this tinted view.\nA better title for this image is &quot;The Smithsonian Institution&quot;.", "authorname": "mystuart (SEASON'S GREETINGS!!)", "id": "36006447-4225802467-72157625331290405", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dcplcommons/4225802467/#comment72157626797601935", "realname": "", "path_alias": "paddrick", "author": "66041448@N00", "iconserver": "23", "datecreate": "1307627816", "_content": "I had fun trying to clean up this old photo a bit.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paddrick/5812591243/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/5812591243_91d8116468_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"562\" alt=\"Smithsonian Castle\" /></a>\n\nSee the larger view at:  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paddrick/5812591243/sizes/o/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/paddrick/5812591243/sizes/o/in/phot...</a>", "authorname": "Paddrick", "id": "36006447-4225802467-72157626797601935", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "4225802467"}}
