The Tomb of the Unknowns has yet to be built but it will be added shortly after this picture was taken.  Note that the front stairs down to the right are not there yet.  That large retaining wall to the right will be removed to make room for the stairs.", "authorname": "outnaway", "id": "36006447-4225801261-72157626682997561", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4225801261"}}
