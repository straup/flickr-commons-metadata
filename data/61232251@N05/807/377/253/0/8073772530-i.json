Peddie's \u00a3800 bond on that property was amongst those 'left out of view' and the Peddie family had to subscribe heavily towards the \u00a325,940 missing from the accounts of the Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers which he had been raiding since at least 1845. Still more seriously Peddie's property, hydropathic and hotel companies all became insolvent from 1880 onwards with frequent calls for more capital. Making money thus became even more important than it had been, and the elder Peddie devoted the rest of his life to developing his international business interests and investments. It was on a voyage encompassing Australasia and the United States to inspect some of these operations in 1885 that Euphemia died and her body was brought home for burial in Dean Cemetery on 31 December. The elder Peddie himself died on 12 March 1891, leaving moveable assets of \u00a326,432 2s 10d, liabilities of \u00a310,002 13s 0d, his houses in Buckingham Terrace and Chalmers Street and the heavily mortgaged office building at 122 George Street. His net moveable estate was calculated at \u00a316,429 9s 10d but because of bonds the net worth of his heritable property interests is difficult to guess.&quot;   -  <a href=\"http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202322\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202322</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3282", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-10-10 09:41:49", "lastupdate": "1369940961", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1349873077"}, "originalsecret": "de9eab195b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8035", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nsarchives/8073772530/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
