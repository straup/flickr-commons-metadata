The WF Page Building on the left would be the current TD Building location...and the building just past Granville St, is the one that recently housed the Elephant and Castle (with the columns). The Building on the right (CPR Telegraph in the photo) still stands...I believe that's the Dennis Building. Take a street view on Google Maps...and zoom in a bit...you'll see it. I would guess it's taken in the WWI era given the Victory Bonds and &quot;To Hell with the Kaizer&quot; signs on the cars.\n-Jeff Bishop @jbish", "authorname": "jeff.bishop", "id": "61226911-6189113425-72157627692122689", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nsarchives/6189113425/#comment72157627816195984", "realname": "Nova Scotia Archives", "path_alias": "nsarchives", "author": "61232251@N05", "iconserver": "5456", "datecreate": "1317736316", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffbishop] Thanks, Jeff!
