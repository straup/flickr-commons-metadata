The mountain in the background of the picture is Rundle Mountain. I worked at Sulphur Mountain, which is now the site of the Banff Gondola, and saw this view everyday. The wood in the foreground is most likely  a part of the weather station that was run on top of the mountain. The picture had to be taken sometime between late June and Early September. If you go today the view still of the valley and Rundle Mountain looks exactly the same!", "authorname": "observher", "id": "61226911-6189109617-72157627930713806", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nsarchives/6189109617/#comment72157635049556850", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21891888@N00", "iconserver": "5343", "datecreate": "1376352538", "_content": "i love that the horse is checking out the view. i've read that horses will appreciate landscapes. i've been on a trail ride in the absoroka mountains where the drop off the trail seemed similar to this. the horses weren't phased, i was. i worshiped the horse i rode on and all trail horses.", "authorname": "minions & myrmidons", "id": "61226911-6189109617-72157635049556850", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6189109617"}}
