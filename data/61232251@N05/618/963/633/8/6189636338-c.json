In 1917 Mr. Paige was general manager of the Port Arthur Shipbuilding company in Ontario, and remained in that position for three years.  In 1920 he was operating manager of the Halifax Shipyards, Nova Scotia, where he also remained for three years.\n\nI am a great nephew of James Paige and I do have more information on his life.  Would be glad to share.  A very interesting man.\n\nBob Barrass\nOttawa", "authorname": "Molly1995", "id": "61226911-6189636338-72157629238230542", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nsarchives/6189636338/#comment72157635902083824", "realname": "Peter D.
